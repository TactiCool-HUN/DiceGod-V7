Nika felfedezi, hogy azt csin�l amit akar �s hogy a vil�g nyitva �ll el�tte XD
H�t az�rt ha di�ta van akkor di�ta van
De yes
UwU
De
Azt akarom mondani csak ezzel, hogy nem kell leragadni egy dologn�l.
Make your own
And also cooking is fun when you can make shit you like
The way you like it
And its a great adventure and exploration
So you might discover something that you actually like
Should we bring you a sauce?
You can put it on a healtier kind of noodle to make it less impactful against your diet
My words exactly
Honestly i still don't like cooking even after cooking for myself for a month xD
Well...then youll just get used to it xd
I'd much rather just throw shit into the microwave and eat that xD
Nem is f�ztem olyan sokszor az�ta
Tal�n ha 5-6szor �lltam neki eddig, nagyobb 2-3 napos adagokat csin�lni
De yeah, i don't find fun in cooking
And i think i never will
Az egyetlen dolog ami f�z�s alatt elvonja a figyelmem hogy ne legyen ny�g, az az hogy zen�t nyomok j� hangosan hogy a M�rk ne hallja a hangom
*I dunnooooo*
We can get you rice noddles to go with it
That takes 30 seconds to cook, and it has negligable calories
Knowing you the amount of sauce you'd use is also close to nothing xD
<:sipsmmm:1138914815172169901>
*f i n e*
:'D
Alright we'll get you a carbonara + a bag of rice noods
*Thank u* :'D

So he did
Fucking madlad xD
Az igen xDDDD
Balls of steel
Alright seems like I'm not going to VP today
Oh
I'd arrive after 17:00 so I'll have no time for nothing before my last bus home
Sheesh
Im�dom, hogy h�tk�znap is ilyen rosszak a t�megk�zleked�si opci�k
Cuz falu
ez is orb�n hib�ja
I have a bus at 14:47 which means no shower for me
After that I have one at 16:09
That does not go to VP so I have a 20 min wait in Zirc
cringe
Not as cringe as you
no
well sad
mert akkor �n sem megyek be szerintem
Holnap megyek mindenk�ppen cuz I need my acid from Rossmann
*Just casually going in Rossmann buying stomach acid*
(I know it's not that but that's what came into my mind xD)
Fuck yes I do
I had enough of Peter
I need to... (di)solve this issue

Just the drug

Ye
Mikor?
Day 10. and 11.
The szatyordemon but with a bit more dorito in him
More barbarian, less **long**
I always imagined him as more of a thief, since he climbs on everything, tries to break into everything, and eat whatever you leave out on the counter or table
He'd be anything but a thief xD he's too clumsy and loud to be a thief
And he never really steals stuff, but if he do, he does so in front on your face
And he often slips and falls when climbing
He however punches and grapples everything xD
And the Prince who ascended into an angel
XD Balfasz thief
*Rest in peace baby*
You have to start somewhere
we will miss zou Prinve
https://youtu.be/Xvgq8jnRKz8?si=QgjtlfjANjMo84t-
I can give context. Once he tried to take a bit if garlic chicken out of my plate. He got close and tried licking my spoon that I took away before he could do anything, so he followed it, stepping into the saucy plate, got panicked, kicked a piece if chicken out of it and ran away
As I cleaned the mess up he went and snatched up the kicked away chicken
Once he successfully opened the cabinet door to the trash and got in to rummage for them fried chicken bones. The door closed on him and he tried getting out, but he decided to pull the door on his own paw instead of pushing. He was hissing as he continues hurting himself
https://tenor.com/view/wheeze-laugh-gif-14359545
Some Looney Tunes slapstick scenarios
Oh yes for sure
He is a shitshow of a cat

i hate you dicegod
i love 8 kb internet speed
;-;
i love 2 kb internet speed
D:
25 mb dota update is going to take me 4 days
i can just about hear it
what do you need

you don't really need that much int
that might be for when you start with diddly dick
what was the question in question though
500 xp to spend?
you can only buy things on the list and only once i assume

oke that checks out

so i'd advise to get at least 1 in charm
it's basicaly to improve your relation with ppl
willpower is going to be useful so probably also 1 into that
int is a huge *maybe* depending on if you want to be a medic
cuz otherwise you won't have much use of int
oh int is 500 for you, yeah int is your dump stat
you're not gonna use it almost at all
yeah flamers are a good
good choice
i played a flamer based sister of battle before
yeah you are the fellowship guy
get dodge
cuz it's amazing fucking mileage
so i'm just gonna tell it to you both, dodge is basicaly
well not king but
it is the cheapest and easiest way for you to negate dmg
yeah you can do awareness
perception
cuz you basicaly never roll the raw stats themselves
what did you win?
but won what
where how
110
oh that i see
101
i love gambling but i'm gonna get 50
sure let me roll rn
-r 20d10
i drop the lowest?
oh i see we don't roll for
fame or whatever it's called here
the 10th stat
it's called infamy in black crusade
my boy
50 fellowship means nothing yet
what are the skills at
no i mean
looking at fellowship is a nice gauge
but if you use it with skill you're untrained in
that's a -20
skills are the awareness, dodge, tech use etc
command is the way to go cuz you are the inspiring person
not yet i assume
they really made it look kinda weird
the progression system
dark heresy 1e
rogue trader 
deathwatch
all 3 have the old system
i got them for free
why don't we mark that water then
foundry asks "legit?"
you say "legit, source; trust me bro"
well i am locked out of basicaly all of my resources so i guess i'll be bothering bonbon tomorrow about character creation
who do we have so far though
comissionary
i'll be a psyker
to absolutely fuck the team up so we don't have a singular dedicated combatant
and we'll die to threats of violence instead of violence itself
i will pick the astropath
that was not a threat, that was a promise
our ship litteraly takes off from a space dock
it gets blown the fuck up by orks
i can't load them at all
my net improved to a stunning
80 kb/s
bold of you to assume the pic will load
awesome

what is the biggest class
a frigate is the smallest one
can we get at least a light cruiser
or a cruiser
the battleship means we rival litteral fucking lord solar
that's not a problem
that's just a dangerous amount of dick swinging
that is a litteral strategy if we want to just *never* get into combat
"commander? yeah do you remember that huge ship we passed yesterday, the cool expensive looking one we were scared to rob? yeah so we took a picture, turns out they didn't have any guns"
there's always just ramming
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=2aUBeSJeWNRefqLc
RAMMING SPEEED
if we have a battleship we're litteraly willing to ram into shit
that means we're such big dick swingers we own entire systems
dang but oh well
at least it's at least semi-capable of fighting
fuck you mean 10
i'm -2
yes
i'm gonna be a really bad astropath
i'm litteraly going to be a human version of a portable phone, except that 1 of the lines is connected to a screaming sea of souls
we need competent at least like cmon
see natus you're laughing but
do you know what slaanesh does
slaanesh is a chaos god of pain and pleasure
and there were chaos ships that were *just* the breaking bad van on steroids
if we need money we can just extort a local system
i will call them up and pretend we're the lord solar
I found this guy outside
He looks so weird
But also looked like he has nowhere to go
I couldn�t talk with him he didn�t understand a word
But i gave him food
What do i do now

"yeah so see that huge battle ship that entered the system? yeah neat right? oke now i need you to send all your money to that space dingy next to it"
JESUS FHUCK
Nika you do fucking going insane
WTF
XDDDD
XDDDDDD
"ma'am this is the police, i need you to throw all your valuables through the window, don't look out of it though"
holding a sign
"will preach5money"
when is the gaming time btw
oke
i suggest thursdays or fridays in evenings
awsum
0.3 gb update btw
30 minutes
40 minutes
my net was always bad
well not always just last year or so
nah it's old provider
might be my router tbh
it's not that old
Ahogy eln�zem kapott ruh�kat is? *Nem volt neki?*

the router is mine
yee
oh no that works fine probably
*Also why he lookin' so sussy?*
but the router is mine
Eat your noodles and be thankful XD
*A part of his soul has been captured by the camera but he doesn't know that*
i am called everything
you can still call me iza
the og
oh no
a badzsao
yeah i'll be avaible like
Volt neki de szakadt volt meg mocskos
probably in the afternoon
etgy vizicigy�ny
i have my evening mostly taken
Meg odaadtam neki a holo fila papucsom, mint kider�lt akkora l�ba van mint nekem
but it's fine i can honestly just
Azt mondod?
fill the sheet and send it over
M�g nem tudtam kider�teni micsoda vagy kicsoda
cuz i already know the system
yeah
yeah i don't need guidance
i can just like
we can just talk backstory
which is going to be also so simple i might just write it down
i keep my backstories to like
several sentences
we can talk backstory rn tbh
we have time
if you already went over everything with natus
Nem tudta mit fogok a kezemben amit fel� tartottam hogy lefot�zzam
Meg szerintem g�ze sincs hol lehet, nem biztos hogy b�zik bennem
yeah so i'm an astropath from god emperor only knows what backwater shithole

M�rmint a sr�c aki itt van?
Nem enged a m�r�szalaggal a k�zel�be

oke do you know the myth about
the marathon runner and the turtle
or not a myth, the phylosophical like
theory
Nem tudom de �gy n�z ki j� a l�b�ra
yeah the runner will never reach the turtle in theory
Mutogass neki XD
cuz the turtle is always moving
Draw, girl, draw
but i swear to fucking god that's my net rn
the update says 30 minutes for the past hour
Az lehet m�k�dne

Akkor tal�n �fel�j�k is vannak macsk�k, meg emberek
welcome to the only 3rd world country in a 1st world continent
Annyira nem akadt ki t�led sem ahogy n�zem
Csak vonogatja a szem�ld�k�t
bruh
we had a romanian in natus's game
he had a better net than me
thank you dicegod
Yeaah lehet
De t�nyleg nem t�nik �gy hogy f�lne t�lem
Mondjuk... ki f�lne t�lem xD
Kezd tan�tani magyarul. B�k�dj r� dolgokra azt mond meg, hogy mi az
i swear to fucking god it's 30 minutes all the god damn time
Kezdheted a macsk�val XD
cuz my net went from 150 kb
to now 97
(Reg�)
H�t az lesz a k�vetkez� i think
(Lol)
it's litteraly sinking like the titanic
(Occasionally)
i'm genuinely losing my mind sometimes
cuz these are things that do not happen to regular ppl
(And sometimes the cat when you yell at him not to do some stupid shit)

i ran out of it is what it is cards
Na, most m�r tal�n tudja az "igen"-t meg a "nem"-et
60 kb rn
He doesn't seem stupid so far
to keep that download at a steady
30 minutes
my boy i've been in the call and had 140
it shot to 200 rn
I like how you said 'so far'
M�g t�vedhetek
Maybe he'll get progressively more stupid

yeah it counts since it started
so since bonbon started it
Well i hope not :'D
Hogy fogom meg�rtetni magam vele akkor? XD
Ughh this is hard af
Meg�gyazok neki a nappaliban
it counts additive both your times
Nice. Az�rt figyelmeztesd, hogy lehet a macska �jszaka elkezdi terroriz�lni, meg lehugyozni XD

i want a gnome following my mouse
Szerintwm nem fogja �rteni xD
M�g mindig le tudod rajzolni

i can't see it
cats irl usually hiss at me
I think he'll get a drawing of the Moon being up in the window, him sleeping in bed, and the cat climbing on him or something like that
which is strange considering every single other animal treats me like a disney princess
so he's not a kitsune
*Maybe*
Hopefully
he's a catfolk
Though he might not even know what the Moon is
how
Az�rt azt csak tudja
Maybe they don't have one
do catfolk have a feature or does he have a spell
ok saying "you will see"
when i play a blind character
kinda a low blow
Maybe theirs looks a lot different
Wdym? Honnan m�shonnan j�nne ha nem a F�ldr�l?
??? XD
Nincsenek �rl�nyek xD
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=2aUBeSJeWNRefqLc
Doesn't he have gills on his neck?
Uuuhhhh
Lehet
Nem tudom
Nem engedi hogy nagyon n�zegessem
Egy m�sik vil�g�l ahol lehet nem is olyanok a dolgok, mint itt
Lehet ott nem newtoni folyadwkb�l van a "f�ld"
De hogyan j�tt volna m�sik vil�gb�l?
Vagy sz�raz folyad�kot l�legeznek
Mittudom�n
H�t szerinted ez term�szetes? XD
Nem de att�l el�g emberinek n�z ki
oke doke
take care bonbon
De nem az
Lehet hogy mind csak extreme body modification
oke
byee
�n is erre gondoltam, de
You too Iza! :D
nem furcs�llja a t�bbi cuccot maga k�r�l?
Mert ha igen, ha �gy n�z ki mint aki elveszett... akkor mondjuk lehet valami szerencs�tlen elmeroppant XD
H�t el�gg� megn�zett mindent mag�nak
De am�gy n�zz bele a kopolty�szer� dolgaiba, azt�n ha �tl�tsz rajtuk a beleibe, akkor valszeg nem ember
Nem tudom mi van vele xD
Jesus
Nem akarok belen�zni xD
Az�rt vigy�zz. M�giscsak valami rando
Lehet h�vni k�ne valakit
Yeah vigy�zok dw
Ha valami van sz�lok
De egyel�re nyugodtnak t�nik
De aludnod is kell xd
Valamikor
�s lehet � akkor fog valamit tenni
Az�rt h�vj �t p�r embert
De az b�rmikor v�lrozhat. Nem ismered
Igazad lehet
Mindj�rt sz�lok valakinek
*A rend�rs�gnek* XD
*Annak m�g nem* xD
(Scorpio gets taken by the po-po)
(XD)
Am�gy mi�rt vil�g�t a torka?
Valami glow stick van a p�l�ja alatt, vagy mi?
*Most j�tt a rave-r�l*
Megivott egy l�val�mp�t
Ilyen f�nyviszonyokra val� tekintettel, az lenne a leger�sebb f�ny� glow stick a vil�gon
Abba belehalna, nem? Hacsak t�nyleg nem ember
De lehet akkor is
(*A grafik�ja is kicsit m�s mint a mi�nk* XD)
(Mi ilyen 4k hiper re�lban toljuk)
(Nem a kedvencem, de h�t ez jutott nek�nk)
I honestly have no clue
De a mellkasa is vil�g�t
Wtf
�tvil�g�t a fekete p�l�mon amit r�adtam
Az nem tudom hogy lehet emberileg
Ilyen Godzilla f�le
Jesus, �s ha t�nyleg nem ember?
Mit csin�lok akkor???
Akkor valami vil�g�t� halgyerek
Ilyen m�lytengeri sz�kev�ny
J�, mondjuk ahhoz nem el�g ocsm�ny
(Imagine Scorpio looking like the average deep sea dweller XD)
De h�t itt a legk�zelebbi m�lytenger az a Balaton �s az is csak egy pocsolya egy m�lytengerhez k�pest
Nem
XD
(Dw, I have my triton who does look like that. I loved playing her)
(Tempest cleric was pretty good)
B�lcsen sz�lott�l
Lehet hogy � ilyen emberi k�s�rlet
Nem tudom mi�rt �ppen Magyarorsz�gon van, nem hiszem hogy mi annyira r�hasaltunk volna az ember-hal hibridek gy�rt�s�ra. Lehet sz�ll�tott�k azt�n kiszabadult

Don't worry. He mentions that too XD
I fell off after the end of s2
I think I watched a playthrough of 400 days when that came out but I can't remember anything about it

<@242727379447971840>
I know
but its INKtober
and I didn't ink it
Okay, and how many people do it with actual ink?
Okay but like
Not many
That's the minority
outside of Nika nobody is inking inktober
but I wanted to at least imitate it with digital
*If you don't use real squid ink, and a feather to draw with, you're art is invalid* XD
Okay, you can do that when you have more time. We still have more than half a month
So just post the art for the day, and then you can adjust it later, so you won't feel like it's not authentic enough
you are right

Ye
*his what now*
It went to the store years ago
this dog owner should be euthanised https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/s/b07F0lXDCB
Fuckin dumbasses out here having dogs
I'm not gonna lie, if that was me, I probably would have kicked those dogs. Not like stomp the life out of them, but a firm kick as a deterrent
Because if their owner won't discipline them, or at least keep them on a leash, then I have to show them not to mess with people
Also don't bite me
That is just a universal rule
You bite me, you ask for retaliation
*Imma go Laios on those dogs and their owner*
Now if those weren't just puppies but fully grown dogs and they were still having the same mentality
I'd just die, man, or get hospitalized
These late night posts about dumbass people don't help in getting to the zen zone XD
Dani got stuck in the useless ~zone~ room as I can see
Yea
Tried pinging him already
He ded
Probably sleeping xdd
Yeah, he's asleep by now
Probably fell asleep hours ago
But why he keep the pc on?
Why on dc
Bro xd
Because he can literally fall asleep like that
Bro fell asleep sitting up once, with one of his legs pulled up
Understandable
Hope he sleeps well then xD
Or maybe he's on his phone with earphones or something
But probably the former
He's just like that. He's just *built different*
XD
*ohno he got airpods in, he can't hear us*
He sure is xD
I am kinda jealous. I wish I could sleep in any position, anywhere XD
If I'm not horizontal, in a bed, I'm not catching Zs
And even then it's uncer xD
Those 25 hour bus trips to Montenegro and back were a waking nightmare
I can only imagine
Szerencs�re buszon tudok aludni
Even then it usually takes like an hour. Several if it's a particularly bad night
I could barely adjust my seat because the lady sitting behind me was whining about there being not enough space or something
That lady was shorter than me
They just want a reason to whine xd
My long ass legs were struggling
My back and mind was too
I was just going in and out in seconds, sometimes a street light flashed into my eyes
I don't want a repeat if that
Ye that's a struggle
I'd rather take a few hours long flight
Or even a train is more comfortable xd
And I've never been on a plane before. I think my stomach would crawl to my spine on takeoffs and landings
Maybe a lil ye
Definitely. I'd love to travel on a train that was made to accomodate people for overnight travels
With sleeping quarters
Actual beds
Ah ye that'd be dope
Like on the Orient express

Yeaaaa

Ships I don't trust that much though
Nem par�ztam amikor egy haj�n �jszak�ztunk az angliai �ton, de
Legalul lenni egy haj�ban... Nah, man. I'd avoid it if I have the chance
If I had the chance, I'd sleep on top of the ship, on board, in a secured tent or something. A little custom booth XD
You ain't taking me down to the deep sea, ship!
Once I had a dream about walking on the ocean floor in a dim green light, like in those night vision cameras, and the deep sea abomination fishes were swarming me, they swam all around me with their inky black bodies
I don't know why I didn't have a heartattack during that dream. Instead it felt calm
Fairly calm
It was still a nightmare hellscape
I dc-d him

In WWII, Hungary had finally declared war on the USA. An envoy is sent to the US embassy, where they handed over the formal declaration. After which the following conversation took place:

 - Kingdom.

 - Okay, then who's the regent?
 - Admiral Mikl�s Horthy.
 - Admiral? So do you have access to the ocean?
 - No.
 - Okay. Do you have any territorial claims against the USA?
 - No, we do not.
 - Do you have territorial claims against other countries?
 - Yes, against Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania...
 - And are you waging war against them as well?

So do we wanna make "Scorpio's adventure to find themselves" canon?
/jk
BROTHER
STHAPH
Lacaine only needed the team alive to keep Yria alive so he can use her as a final sacrifice if his ritual :)
And we are bringing her right to him :)))
The curse of "We need a healer tho" amirite?
https://tenor.com/view/omg-oh-my-god-crying-omg-no-gif-16948248
Making the Yria in danger joke is like beating a dead horse for the 1000th time
There is barely anything left
*Just let my babies peacefully retreat to their normal lives finally*
She is simultaneously the least and most abused character xd
Well there's definetly *something* up with Yria is what I'll say xD
Says the person who wants to go kill greatwyrms and that behemoth XD
Jk
That's just a side hustle
XD
XD
Hopefully not Lacaine's plan
In the back garden of the teahouse there will be kaiju fights going on
It's Leoris' plan
Wat
<:cat_loading:1197294987394699265>
What do you know? Do we need to know?
You will know xdd
Oriolus always knows xD
XD
Can we know before shit hits the fan?
HAH
<:point:951578243415302235>
Sure xX
But barely shares xd
*Shit hits the fan*
XDDD
Hey :c
It's like farting right behind the fan so it blows into the face of the other
Shit already hit the fan wdym xddd
*There's more shit*
But the mega shit storm is still yet to come
What is happening here?
I DON'T KNOOW
Yes bc Sindor will die
Shut
Stressing people out just to see what happens xD

Btw no I don't know anything. I'm just joking. I know what you guys will face and I'll help Endre set some things up.
Right with you bro
Ooh i know that too
Fhuck guys
Get ready
You tell me the bossfight will be run by three people? XD
Damn would be cool xD
We are already as ready as we currently can get
Did you hear about the anti-Grei Mechadragon with antipsionic and antirogue features?
<@282869456664002581>
It's another thing if we mess up
Or the rolls will fail us
Ye. No crits

Yay :D
*My favorite type of enemy: The one that cancels one person entirely and does nothing to the rest* XD
https://tenor.com/view/axolotl-smile-happy-cute-animal-smiling-gif-12642274
Guys you worry way too much. Endre's a good DM and he won't set things up for you to fail them. He will make things challenging where you have a chance to fail if you mess up or the dice decide against you. But none of our remaining DMs would force a negative campaign end, especially with a beloved game like PoB.
Stop stressing okay? XD
You guys got this
I'm not stressing
Losing is an option, but not a plan.
Whatever happens happens
Honestly
I needed this
Thank you
Maybe I should put them like *this* so you guys won'r assume I am losing my mind from some small bullshit
I mean, i have no doubt Endre is a good DM, i trust him he'll give us one of the best bossfights of the century
I'm just stressed we might fail in a really bad way xD
*i'm not ready*
I am
*but i am not*
*If we'd get TPK it will be hilarious for 5 seconds until the enptiness sets in XD*
XD
We'll do a group-cry
(*have I seen anything like it before*)
(*is she fuckin pregnant*(
�rdekes lenne ha elbukn�nk, az el�gg� �rtana a vil�gnak
Egy p�r sz�z, vagy ezer �vig
I don't know what would happen
If far realm things start spawning on this plane
I am as ready as I am to finish my side things
I am as ready as I am to finish my side things
You're welcome
The only bossfight I read trough and saw planned out that I do not know how the party is supposed to win in any way was the odyssey finale
Cuz that is
Oooof
That is the only real time the game decided to "Fuck it. I'mma go all out."
<:scorpioemotionaldamage:1237447864758566992>

*eeeeeeeeeee*
pressure XD
*I'm sorry*
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I prefer controlling my own characters cus I can oversee stuff better
(uhm.... am I missing something? should I know what Tallulah means? XD)
-r 1d100
(XDDDDD)
(yep, yep)
(XDDD)
I have bad experiences with controlling bosses in other campaigns xD
(Ja nem csak gondolom m�g nem volt csatat�ren xd. Meg nem tudom scorpio hi�ny�ban mennyit besz�lgettel mulandirban, de �gy veszem el�g j� barin�k lenetnek xd)
I did it twice, once I killed someone the other time I ran away the whole session
YOURE NOT MORE SPECIAL
REEEE
Which ones?
And I let Kevin do it once in my game where he decided to just mess with Reg�
Trex
Ooh ye
(Siege of Mulandir? :D)
Was it the cerberussy?
Yupp
Oh and the other one as well
(like literally the city she lives in was besieged and she was the in the group of main defenders :D)
(Oh ye...that happened)
Where he decided to stand in a corner and spam
(xd)
Instead of actually using the abilities of the characters
Hhhhh
Okay that was enough xD
Pressure why?
(I'm just *a little* confused xD)
(do you wanna rephrase?)
(Yes i will km just in class)
(kk)
Because Nika said he will give us one of the best boss battle of the century XD
It might be, but no pressure
Lucky for him we don't have a lot of final bossfights in any given decade xD
Yeah
At the very least it will be one of the boss battles of all time

*What in the D100?*
alt ori
Ctrl Alt Ori
Control ori
(Amazing xD)
(now the question is do I tell them and lose a healer or not tell them and lose a healer in a different way xDD)
(XD)
Most certainly
<:oricry:1266108627366711368>
new spell just dropped
Dominate Ori
<:UwU:959931778905276456>
So
Uhm
And sindor busts through the door and yell "PILLOW FIGHT"
I misread it
XD
(tytt� = girl)

that is what:
Suggestion: "take a walk" is for
xDDD
*hey baby grill*
Nuuuu

soooooooooooooooo
u guys remember ToA?
and Chult
Ya
and more importantly Ubtau?
Ye
Ye
Yessir
I always thought it was Uptau. Never seen that name written before
ah sorry Ubtao
bzt ye
sooooo
Ubtau is currently in the Outlands, in a place called Labyrinth of Life
a tangled meandering jungle where dinosaurs run rampant ***including Ubtao himself, who roams his forest maze as a tyrannosaurus rex.***
xDDD
<@875753704685436938> 
hey babe, new trex just dropped!
(Primordial edition)
xDDD
https://tenor.com/view/dj-khaled-another-one-one-gif-5057861
We already thought a T-Rex in ToA
New flavor
And it only took one person down... *Wonder who that was* xd
https://tenor.com/view/im-out-gif-9484683639636500270
Yes the King if Feathers
Heh
Zombie Rex
<:point:951578243415302235>
Some Primal type thing
Akkor 2 Trex volt Toa-ban xD
That bitch was king of no feathers xDD
Yeah, it's hard to keep feathers when you are rotting away
At least it had magic feathers
Ye but the zombie
That none of you used cuz the party only has hoarders
:)
Ah
Well
Mit csin�ltak azok a tollak?
I don't even remember what they did xD
That was a lit fight
misty step
Idfk
It was legendary
I don't remember xD
But you had a lot of them
I don't remember if I had any, but I was playing a tempest cleric so I think I was doing fine without them
I don't think you fought him
I was there
Akkor m�g nem mentem el koliba
Ha j�l eml�kszem
At the feathered rex?
Oh you were? Really? The king was right before the final dungeon and from what I remember you joined during the dungeon.
�n �gy eml�kszem voltam abban a fight-ban
De ki tudja
De, mert ut�na eltemett�k Zikit �s �n is mondtam p�r sz�t a temet�s�n
Ha j�l eml�kszem Ziki halt meg abban a fight-van
�s nekem m�g �gy r�mlik viszonylag alacsony szint�ek voltunk
Az a zombi
Az a kamp�ny eleje
A zombi T-Rex
A king a v�ge fele volt
Ja
Jaaa
Azt hittem a zombir�l besz�l�nk
Ja, a m�sik nem r�mlik nekem, sz�val akkor t�nyleg �ppen nem voltam ott

This bitch
Yeah, no
I got them mixed up for a moment
Couldn't have been more legendary of a fight than the zombie one
Where we all should have died if it wasn't for that one rock formation
Ngl, he kinda looks dumb
What is that rhino horn brother?
Also
Mi�rt van az egyik h�ts� l�b�n n�gy l�bujj?
A m�sikon is szerintem 4 van, csak h�tr�bb �s takarva van
Nah
Nem is �gy helyezkednek a bal l�b�n �gy, hogy egy�ltal�n lehets�ges legyen h�trahajtani
This art is some goofy stuff
A jobbon meg clearly csak h�rom van
And it's a T-Rex. A theropod
Three fingers on the hind legs
Oh wait
Ott a negyedik, csak nagyon beleolvad
Still
Y tho
This was really the best they could come up with?
Okay, WotC. Okay
Yeah, you were right
Of course I was
�n nem erre a k�pre eml�kszem xDD
De nem is eml�kszem sokra a fightb�l so
Mert nem ezt haszn�ltam
Ah okay
Gud xD
I used some other pink purple feathery dino cuz
Well
This is ugly xD
Kinda ye xD
Yee yee ass T-Rhino
With an extra finger but for what? XD
I think they wanted to put in the little extra thingy they have
But that is not supposed to touch the ground
(You think Yria would be any safer if you left her behind? Lol)
(no not at all xD)
(The question is, do you bring a pregnant woman into an active battlefield, or leave her to become a bargaining chip for later? )
<a:dracthyr_hehe_animated:1004776114935316480>
Still doesn't touch the ground on the art either. Csak nagyobb �s b�szm�bb
(oh wait this isn't abyss)
�s kicsit m�shogy �ll
Szeg�ny Barny
On the left foot it does seem like it would touch it tho
But yes
It is a fucked leg either way

Akkor M�rkon k�v�l mindenki lesz, ha j�l �rtelmezem

Sent xD
I listened UwU
OwO
Damn, nem gondoltam volna hogy actually belehallgattok xD
I did too
�n szoktam. MtoE-ben is szoktam jel�lgetni azokat amiket meghallgattam, �s azokat amiket actually lementettem a playlist-embe
Csak van amikor egy ideig nem n�zem azt a csatorn�t, �s akkor sokkal kell catch up-olnom
*Lehet nem magamb�l k�ne kiindulni �s azt gondolni hogy senki m�g csak r� se n�z* :'D xDDDD
*El�fordulhat* XD
I usually don't listen to musics just randomly sent in
Bad habit of mine
�ltal�ban azt szoktam meghallgatni amit kifejezetten nekem k�ldenek vagy ha valaki �r valamit a bek�ld�tt link mell� hogy milyen maga a zene
I'm not usually a fan of clicking on stuff and not knowinv what to expect
Ooops <:scorpioemotionaldamage:1237447864758566992>
�n se felt�tlen�l �gy �llok hozz�, hogy biztos mindenki meghallgatja, de bek�ld�m, mert nem akarom kiz�rni a lehet�s�get h�tha valakinek m�snak is m�gis tetszene
Utaz�skor, vagy amikor valami�rt be kell mennem a v�rosba, t�k j� hogy nem kell keresg�lnem sz�mokat, hanem ott vannak, �s a nagy r�sz�ket m�g sosem hallottam, ami nice
Olyan dolgokb�l amikr�l eddig nem is tudtam hogy l�teznek
Olyan band�kt�l, vagy el�ad�kt�l
Understandable, b�r nekem teljesen m�s ilyen szempontb�l, �n mindig j�l megv�logatom mit akarok �pp hallgatni, i'm a mood-listener xD
�n is, de id�nk�nt szeretn�k �j dolgokat is hallgatni, pl�ne olyanokat amiket a bar�taim k�ldenek be
User growth of a standard subreddit (like r/news):
�s az�rt el�g picky vagyok zen�kkel, de legal�bb egyszer mindent szeretn�k meghallgatni ami oda be lett k�ldve
User growth for r/layoffs:
User growth for r/canadajobs (ppl looking for work):

*Clones*
I think the only album I can listen to anytime, no matter what mood I'm in is Demon Days from Gorillaz
It just makes me feel
Happy? I don't know
No matter which song I hear from it, I always vibe with it
I don't even know if there's anything, album, song, that I could listen to anytime no matter my mood
I don't think there is any
It was hard for me too. This is basically the only album, and songs, which are like this to me
All the songs are hits
And that's like a unicorn XD
Mythical beast
Hah okay that's fun xD
I'm interested if there's one for "Please bring adventurers who actually want to adventure."
Live performances of it are not the best tho X_D
I do have a favourite album and a song that i could listen to ***almost*** anytime, but there's no album nor song i could start in any given moment and vibe with it each time
There's just... nah, no, if i'm not in that general mood, i'm not listening, not even that one favourite song xD
They can be hilarious tho
Tho, to be fair, my favourite songs are mostly moody, and i am almost always moody xD
*Moody in the hoodie*
XD
*However*, i like walking to badass songs xD
Nice
https://tenor.com/view/ben-stiller-badass-walk-walking-zoolander-gif-15861491
Yes xD
*Not me with my favourite album, which is called 'Love Yourself: Tear'*
Sometimes, me too, but there are other times when I just want something chill, or the opposite, terrifying, like I'm the only person left
Send it into MtoE
Hmmm
If i can find a complete album playlist

You'd get really sick from it before getting drunk \:P

If you wanna cry, drink p�linka
I actually want to bring u guys some Finnish alkohol
Hellyeah

Or he could start with something that's easier on the stomach xD
Baileys is full of cream, and we're talking about Endre
It's called gl�gi (not the same as German gl�gi)
You hit it up in a pot and it has like a berry-mix taste
I did actually like the non-alcoholic version
In that case we have what you'll drink

Nem
What common ground are you on especially
Altony
Rem�nykedtem hogy valaki az abyss teamb�l mondja de ya
Nvm
I barely knew him
XD
Eh
Whatever
I thought we nwwded to think of a real person
It makes sense now xD
Yeah, channel context
What is happening here
Eh nothin
I thought it was meant to be one of us
Until it said doesn't know what a pronoun is
Yes Alton be like
I can't really put it abyss now can I????
He can be the kind of flavour you want him to be
sry I didn't get into his romantic/nsfw side enough to really have this stick in my brain
*bruh*
But at least a OotA tag
Heh? XD
That would've helped a lot
But I give it to Altony
Oh we did. Reg� more than me tho xD
He was
all
I didn't do Alton. Not yet at least
Didn't have to tho
I literally don't make a note on someone's gender outside of romantic/nsfw interactions
He was a just shapeshifter
So in general he's everything
Me neither
soooo
just like Scorpio too early on
Ami k�sik nem m�lik
The ruler of everything
HMMMM
Scorpio is Scorpio-gender
Ye
for me Alton only stuck as "the schizo wizard who runs away from stuff" xD
XD
Ok
Fair enough
For me he remained as the "Guy, for who I'm too boring to befriend."
Didn't we keep the combat wizard emoji?
<:Altony:986669432472473630>
There it is
xDD
XD That sure sounds like what he'd think

*fuckin third-caster martial*
I remember when I tried piecing together his mind split
With Norco
XD
That was fun xD
The meme
Yess
Send it in, please XD
Who? O.o
Wha
Wait lehet rosszul eml�kszem
Nem volt caster egy�ltal�n?
Leo was 100% martial
Nice xD
Nikita was the paladin
Akkor csak *fuckin martial* xD
He was just blessed with magic items that hold more spellslots than the local wizard guy
Yep
True xD
Uuuh
I was also a paladin, until I had to switch character
And then warlock
Nincs meg tel�n xd
Oh well
Az alap f�jl is elt�nt

N�lad megtal�ltam xD

xd
I was a dragon knight until I reclasses into dragon knight xD
Yeah XD
Wow xD
(cuz Kevin didn't allow me to become a paladin or cleric/fighter for reasons)
Okay but like guys
Leoris ancients paladin oaths
Like bro
That is him
He could have been him
Literally him XD
Rewrite him xD
*Now u can*
Mi az hogy nem engedett X classt j�tszani?
Wtf???
XD "De annak nincs k�ze Morau-hoz"
I thought Noric would live to join the goats or maybe have the chance to fight against them and turn a new leaf... <:squeeze:1255214410906075236>
Ha ezt tudom nem engedtem volna hogy j�tssz n�la, nem �rdelmelt volna meg t�ged
Like obviously, if they seperate why would I want something that connects them?
Oh god the several people are typing has been triggered xDD
XD everyone's abyss ptsd triggered
while Kevin's reason was absolute BS

multiclassing is something the DM can shut down if it doesn't fit as it is a 100% optional rule
Ye but paladin xD
De mi az hogy nem engedek meg hivatalos classt a j�t�kosomnak hogy j�tsszon?
az az, hogy *doesn't fit the campaign*
Still a dick move when it fits the character
It wasn't multiclassing. I told him that I'm not having fun with Dragon Knight for reason X and Y and Abyss had a [1 free rebuild] per player for this reason
Ye helyette nem Dani hanem �n destroyoltam a combatjait a paladinnal
yes I don't argue that
oh
xD
dumb
xD
but that's just Kevin things
<:point:951578243415302235>
I used it and he didn't let me rebuild as
- Paladin
- Ranger
- Fighter
Or 
- Cleric
This is something i no longer look over
Wtf?????
Nothing else fit so I chose another dragon knight to keep the connection he wanted
Something he later used against Leo obviously xD
Na bassza meg most felbasztam magam
I'm just laughing xD
It was a mess
yea, I am ***very*** happy I left that campaign
it felt a bit like I was just doing a dick move but nah
Nah
Az sosem dick move ha valaki ki szeretne l�pni
Mert nem �li a j�t�kot
Jobb mint amikor nem �li, �s marad
dual pummel from Kriszta and Kevin was too much xd

<@618475228695232532>
hek ye
Well
New canon event
�n sem tudtam multuzni kamp�ny alatt xd
Kriszt�bak is �gy kellet kik�ny�r�gni meg kij�tszania
Yes pls
Oh yes. "ne agg�dj van egy jobb �tletem" *Barbarian/barbarian "multiclass"*
With the weakest barbarian subclass
It isn't the weakest. It's just not damage oriented.
multisubclassing
xD
And when i was like "i have a better idea" he was "ez vagy semmi"
The only thing you wanted from Therius
and making me recode the sheet for it to work xD (tbh didn't mind but still xD)
Nem hogy multizni sem tudt�l, a m�gikus fegyver amit nagy nehezen kapt�l, ann�l sem engedte meg, hogy visszaj�jj�n, miut�n eldobod
Ami �gy lett ki�p�tve, hogy dobva hasznos
Yes ez�rt rangednek kellett lennie xd
Ranged hammer cannon
since that btw I implemented the Planeshifter's two subclasses (as it chooses two of them) to work this way too lol :D
the 1/combat attacker
xDDD
I cant remember correctly
Nem eml�kszem mit tudott a sunforger ut�na
nothing?
XD
dunno I only heard stories
That was really sad cuz Kevin did finally give Reg� what he wanted, but in close to the worst way possible. He gave a ranged weapon to a character that uses natural weapons in melee from Beast barb.
Most if not all of these could've been like a no prob thing for a DM
Yea
Its whatever
Im only waiting for the next soul grinding hellish campaign now
Ezt mondtam neki is. De mindig mondta, hogy nem akarja megengedni mert akkor mindenki mindig �jra�p�tgetn� a karakter�t.
tbh what would've been cool is like
making this ranged thrown hammer like he did
but where he throws it, it stays and creates an aura within which he gains buffs for his tankiness or unarmed dmg
That's just not how it works XD
and then recalled at the end of combat or as BA to reposition on battlefield
Yeah. It blew up thow if i threw it
It had a mini fireball and then it fell down to the ground xD
I was fine with my things, didn't want to change mechanics, classes, anything beside that end Noric got
De csak szerintem nincs ezzel baj?
the only change needed was it to stay floating and ungrab-able and give +2 to attacks to therius in the aoe
xD
I would've never rebuilt Alton either xdd
Nem az zavart felt�tlen�l, hogy meghalt, hanem hogy elvesztette az eml�kezet�t, c�ltalan lett el�gg�, �s ut�na ki lett v�gezve xd
He had to be pure wizard
Pure wizard is best wizard
<:point:951578243415302235>
Ok�, de olyan furcsa dolgokn�l h�zta meg a hat�rvonalat

El�rasztott minket *legendary* fegyverekkel, k�pess�gekkel
De egy szimpla klasszv�lt�s nem j�het sz�ba
Amiket nem mindenki k�rt
Azok n�lk�l is meglett�nk volna
I know de nem is azt mondom. Azza szerintem semmi baj ha kamp�ny alatt valaki �t akarja dolgozni a karater�t
continuity can be really broken if ppl just constantly rebuild
imagine watching a show and each episode the main character can suddenly do stuff he explicitly couldn't before and don't do stuff he was good in before
Csak nem egyb�l egyik sessionr�l a m�sikra, max ha mechanikai gondok vannak
yea, sometimes it is okay
No i mean just gameplay wise
constantly I agree is a problem
Character development
Persze, nem kell break neck-ben �tv�ltani
it can happen, but that is definitely gradual or needs some downtime for it or smth
or some major event
De az el�g szomor�, amikor egy sz�modra �j klasszal kezdesz, r�j�ssz, hogy nem tetszik, vagy elveszi a kedvedet az, hogy alulteljes�tesz a csapatt�rsaiddal szemben, �s csak �gy v�lthatod le ha ingame h�napokat kell m�st csin�lnod, k�zben pedig tal�n irl-ben is eltelik annyi, mert elmaradhatnak a session-�k. That's a rough scenario

<:point:951578243415302235>
De persze ott van a m�sik is, amikor valaki minden session-�n �j dolgot akar xd
It was just weirdly done in OotA
There could've been a middle road
Oota was a typical case of "My way or the high way" style of DMing sadly
The premise was really cool and some of his additions were actually really good
good ideas
trash execution
that's my take
xD
But the fact that he demanded everyone to take part in text based rp cuz "Pob is catching up daniel" and similar things just killed everything
both for the prewritten and the homebrew stuff xddd
Oh yeah eml�keztek mikor �ssze�lt�nk �s mindenki le lett baszva, hogy nem RP-z�nk eleget mert az on session nem el�g? XD
Azzal a besz�lget�ssel, eml�keim szerint, semmi sem lett v�ltoztatva semmin
XD
Yupp
I have a firm stance on OotA forcing it so much killed most of the group's rp vibe
I still didn't rp cuz well
I wasn't feeling it
Hogy legyen t�bb in session rp, ne legyen bitching senkit�l
He kind of wanted abyss to become our part time job
And he was frustrated that pob had more rp so he pushed for abyss to have more and more
Cuz abyss is only abyss if we rp every day
hhhhhhhhhhhh
Pob hype picked up and that didn't sit well with him as Abyss hype died down. Only a few of us were putting in that extra work, but that extra work was met with more expectations and harsh punishments (yes, the more you roleplayed the more storybeats he got to use against you, so you suffered more)
Sz�val lassan mindenki abbahagyta mert nem volt kifizet�d�
I got the best stuff almost always (which I told him to split up btw)
And also main story at some point became Abyss main story + Leoris
Something that I actually wrote multiple big ideas for, for every character to break Leoris' chokehold on the story
But none of them were used and Leoris got a war counceling scene with another chosen of Amaunator

<:arthurfist:727561133149650945>
Dunno why everything worked in reverse with him
The less I wanted the spotlight the more he forced Leo into it.
"You helped me a lot so enjoy"
Bro this is not how the game works!
Maybe... but you still don't rp enough
Well yes xD
Ah it was a clusterfuck
And the ending was needed, but sad
<@886672003396927530> 
btw I really need you to start rp-ing more in PoB
Huh
xDDDD
He talked about the ending for me during a long walk, but didn't mention the tophat god guy so that was unexpected xD
xD
Sure. My OC Aren is still alive right?
(so what's up here? mit kell �tfogalmazni?)
You wish
We deleted him from existance
Alt+F4
Delete
Poof
Boom
Oh and also the ending
God damn
And your OC is Uptok, no?
gimme a sec and I'll get him back
We almost beat the fucking overbuffed Baphomet
b r u h
We bloodied it and had recourses left
Hellyeah. Thx
oota was so unrewarding by the end
(Semmit. Arra v�rnak, hogy meg�rjam, hogyan �rkezik meg Leoris)
Yeah, it felt empty
(*AT THIS TIME HE WASN'T EVEN AN ITCH IN HIS DADDY'S BALLSACK*)
:)))
how fun
(At this time not even his great grandad would have been an itch)
To this day I still don't know what I could call canon about my character's ending XD
Zorahnak meg el kellett t�rnie a l�bait meg majdme meg�lni negyedj�re, hogy t�rt�njen vele valami xdddddd
(there you go, so what do you wanna do with Leo here? XDD)
I wanted him to overcome the eldritch parasite somehow, and have its knowldege or at least something
(done)
(sorry guys I kept forgetting)
At this point basically anything. The next loop isn't fixed in the story so any of the characters could achieve anything within reason
Nikit�val meg �sszeh�zasodtak xy is� ut�n, azt Nik�bal ledum�ltuk
(rem�lem nem leszek kirakva a kamp�nyb�l)
uuugh im so jelouse
(Woo Yria)
i wanna go to sweden
LOOOL
Gold leoris and blue leoris
(So... i see xD okay �jra�rom a reagom xD)
(My ass)
(Or Blue Scorpio vs Gold Scorpio)
yes
�s az �j loop-ban �l Noric, akit �gy veszem, hogy a csapatnak siker�lt meggy�znie hogy besz�ljen a tes�ival �s hagyja el a WF-et
its really sad
also words of affirmation and positive reinforcement is also less with men
legal�bb is amit eddig �n tapasztaltam
Because that's still a more fulfilling ending then being written out of the story like he initially was
Yeaaaaa
(Edited)
(Hek ye)
Just a dog with lost memories crushed to death in 1,5 rounds
He was so goddamn confused he made me confused XD
(ohoho ne agg�dj majd kibontakoznak azokb�l a p�nc�lokb�l skorpi� el�tt :PP )
also
tiip is still dead xdddddd
i think
No, I don't think
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=2aUBeSJeWNRefqLc
Mert ugye �j loop
Leo gave up as champion of Amaunator to give something to Therius who needed a calling in life. His artifact lost power and died (I'll drop the reignition story). He started traveling, married Zorah, later 2 more women, became the stepdad of Kisk + boyfriend of Therius.
�s Zorahban benne volt, hogy megmentse Tiip-et is, ha j�l eml�kszem
�gyhogy szerintem elmentek �rte ahhoz a h�l�s helyhez
Yesss
Nikita meg miut�n a csal�dja sz�pen �l gener�ci�kon �t, felveszi a L�mp�s Angyal szerep�t �s kord�ban tartja Gaizt meg a d�monokat
Eventually turning into a guardian angel of some sorts
- Nem sz�vesen csin�lom, de ha egy ilyen "d�mon" kez�ben van akkor musz�j tenn�nk ellene valamit.
*V�laszolja egy szomork�s v�llvon�ssal.*
- Gondolom neked nem lesz annyira nagy �jdons�g, Nagaka alatt sok tennival�d volt az �vek alatt.
(UwU)
Yes. Kriszta mondta is, hogy nem hagyja Tiipet meghalni az �j loopban
*That sounds like he became a stepdad to Therius' boyfriend XD*
*Kedvesen mosolyog �s s�hajt egyet.* -Mondhatni. Legink�bb a saj�t c�ljaim fel� sodortak az �rak. *V�lla f�l�tt r�pillant Scorpiora majd vissza Yri�ra.* -Lenne itt sz�modra valamim.
oh, okay
the peeps here are like
"okay so we can only stay 90 days in the country at once but erasmus is 120 days, so we need to go and spend a day in another country"
sz�val 200 eur��rt airbnb (k�t �jjel)
+90 euro az aut� b�rl�s, �s csak ott kint t�ltenek egy napot azt�n volt egy szabad hely �s �gy d�nt�ttek elr�ngatnak
Interesting theory
damn
Therius is the stepdad of Kisk
No he isn't xD
Leoris sends him to him so he can learn more about the religion and being an ambassador to the heresy
Best he can be is uncle \:P
sure
Rival religion so that is off the table as well xD
Sorry
Especially after the heresy left
its my fantasy
expecially after i killed everyone in the heresy
Oh wait in the new loop Leo had nothing to do with the Heresy
and became the ultimate god
yes
Dman Therius did everything this time around xD
(egy kisangyal s�gott a f�l�be, hogy k�nnyebb legyen)
yes
de ott volt neki Leoooo
Dawn
Noon
mge
mi volt  a harmadik?

*K�rdezi meglep�dve. Majd pillant Scorpi�ra egy m�sodpercre. Majd kicsit aggodalmasan felhozza:*

De ha nagyon szimbolikusak akarunk lenne, lehetett volna a noon sisak, vagy nyakl�nc, �s a midnigy a p�nc�l

*The night before the siege Scorpio suddenly feels the world fading as he meditates cuddled up with Yria. Suddenly he falls into deep dark waters. It's another one of Nagakaburous' visions but somethings amiss, the waters are hazy with a purple mist and the vision feels... weak.*
- His presence is closing in on our world. The so called *gods* have retreated back to their own fortresses to protect themselves while we must lash out to meet this threat head on. I have heard you and I'll help in what I can. Glance his strengths and be ready for anything.
*Small flashes of the party fighting with a humanoid-looking aberration insues, although the mist hides many details.*
(xD)
*When Nagaka says "be ready for anything" Scorpio feels his powers fresh and maliable again.*
(you can change up to 5 of your known spells to any other spells that are available to you)
# HOLY SH
(DAMN)
(I'm off by a few pixels, hmm, I'll just tell you that I wanted to sneak in that the cha score is the highest, just accidentally drawn the small line on it xd)
(Oh my god xD)

*As the vision goes, Scorpio makes sure that Nagaka feels his newborn confidence and relief that this information unleashed in him.*
� I'll make sure to put these to good use... Thanks! Who knows, this might be the moment that saves the lives of many tomorrow.
*He says even if Nagaka won't reply to him.*
(Ugh)
(xD)
(XD)
It helped

(Yes yes)
(That's the first problem i'm about to solve with my spells)
(Tho i assume before we get to the boss, there might be places where my aoe is needed)
(I might gonna make a spellchanging plan for the siege)
(First loadout, second loadout, etc xD)
(5 of my known spells only include the spells i know through the sorcerer class, or does this include my psion spells too?)
Hah
(can be from either, just replace them with stuff you could put there, aka sorc spells �re� replaced by sorc spells)
I slept for 6 and this was the most I slept this week

Dicegod, will you help me end your creator?

DiceGod you'd never turn on me, right?

But consider that many of those skeletons are very damaged and decayed. You could definitely beat a skeleton that has most of its bones missing. It wouldn't even show up to the fight amd you'd win by default.
knowing my luck, I would fight Ramses or some shit with super oiled up, condensed bones that can block bullets

Throw an old world porcupine at them. Porcupines are the natural predators of skeletons.
They're the reason the only remains of gigantopithecus we have are teeth and some  bone bits. They ate the other bones.

The Dread Lord was pleased with your success!  Tho he has mixed feelings with the talking rug and trophies, he may let you continue living your unholy life in his domain!

Hahahaha. It's all comming together
:)))
PoB team for Chains
Arden kills Yria, brings her soul down to the hells and Scorpio goes down and stucks there for hunderds of years
never
That won't work a 100% cuz Reg� and M�rk are comming to play as well
Well, that sure would be dramatic
+ I'm sure some of you would like to play something new as well
And has to face his past and Arden too, one of his family, to save his girl
Except
yes
bc she is preganto
Mi�rt csak Yri�n�l �llna meg? XD

It would be fun to have a true devil form that looks like a werewolf that's made out of thorny vines

She said if I have an idea for a birthday present tell her
And I'm in IKEA
THE DEAL IS A BLAHAJ�
WHY ����������???
Is that even a question? Dude, a Blahaj is an instant
xD
It's 7 euros tho'
EEEEEEEEEEEE
There is also megablahaj for 25 or something like that
Holy shit
It's like half my size

This is the team loot so far xddd
GODDAMN
I have a better question tho
How dafuq do you have t�rer� and thus internet in there???
WiFi
Oh

Will Scorpio be able to join the Chains party?
That's an even better question

Like how other apps use goigle translate in them

I literally abuse this site

Megk�rtem volna az egyik t�rsamat, hogy hadd keress�k fel egy�tt azt a monostort ahol tartj�k,... de �gy is olyan sokszor fuvaroz engem, �s jelenleg nem akarn�m elszak�tani Mulandirb�l amikor az �j karj�hoz m�r csak az utols� sim�t�sok kellenek... �gy n�z ki sajnos v�rnom kell m�g egy ideig, hogy visszahozhassam... De addig legal�bb tudok besz�lni a lelk�vel.
That's fine

Hell yeah
The bad ending
Leads to another campaign
xD
That is a really cool concept. I'd play a campaign one day where, depending on what ending you get, you could play a sequel campaign that's based on that particular ending
*hm*

PoB bad ending: Chains of Asmodeus

Hmmmm. It would derail a small part of the main premise but it wouldn't be the hardest
One god's plot would fall out of the story. Or the god would have to be replaced by another
But also... PoB loss could also be used as a catalyst to doomed FR story in Ouria \:D

- Sorcha �r,... hall engem?
Weirdly I'm kinda ready for it too
Which hasn't been the case with pob sessions for a while xd
Aww
At least you're ready *now*
:D
Yes DiceGod
DiceGod is ready too
We all ready
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
The beginning of the end
Egyik szemem s�r, m�sik mosolyog
:'D
- Hogy a r�zf�n f�ty�l�j�t, most meg hol vagyok?
*a harmadik meg a spelleket lesi*
K�sz vagy azokkal?
- Egy biztos t�rben, t�vol a Nine Hells-t�l. *Mondja lassabban.*
- Igaz, nem l�thatja, de az otthona melletti erd�ben vagyunk jelenleg. *M�lyen bel�legez.*
- Sajn�lom amit �nnel tettem... A feles�ge nagyon hi�nyolja.
M�r n�zegettem mit hogyan
De nem vagyok m�g meg vele
Sessionre megleszek
B�r szerintem csak 2 fix loadout-om lesz
Meg egy-k�t extra spell amit lehet cser�lnem kell majd
:3
Meg ne felejts�tek el mitek van Tallulaht�l
Oh azt m�r r�g fel�rtam a sheetem k�zep�re :D
Ok�, j�l tetted
*Nothing* XD
(This one died quickly xD)
||~~(still lasted longer than any of my relationships)~~||
(*brooo...*)
Dear <@875753704685436938>, You've reached level 49!
(sry xd)
(I felt the heat of this burn from afar)
- �jra? m�r megint itt? Hogy a fen�be, �n sosem fogom elhagyni ezt a f�ldet huh? De most valahogy nem tudok mozogni, meg minden olyan fura sz�n�... mit tett�l velem boszorka?!

(pfff camp fire isn't Scorpio himself, lame)
(I love how many things are wrong on that picture xD)
(1: he is heat. 2: his can't feel heat with his arm. 3: it doesn't even look like a camp)
XDDD
*Tallulah is kuncog �s meghatottan n�zi a p�rost megbizonyosodva h�s�g�k biztoss�g�r�l.* -Nem is k�v�nn�k b�rkit is kett� v�lasztani. �pp ellenkez�leg. Yria. *B�tor�t�an fordul az elfhez.* -Ha lenne n�v�rem, �pp olyannak szeretn�m mint te vagy. Boldogs�ggal t�lt el l�tni, hogy te �s Scorpio egym�sra tal�ltatok, �s, hogy siker�lt el�rnie �s megtartani a v�gyait. Ez�rt is szeretn�m, ha biztons�gban tudn�lal titeket.
*R�n�z Scorpi�ra komolyabb szemekkel.* -Mindkett�t�ket.
- Tal�n nem �r�l, hogy nem a Poklokban kell k�zdenie?... *Meglepve k�rdezi.*
- A lelk�t siker�lt visszaszereznem a... "felettesemt�l",... az�rt nem k�pes sok mindenre.
Is this specific one tilted, or are all of them tilted?
It was a production malfunction, i know xD some of them in the batch were tilted
- A mif�le pokol? Csak bele lettem dobva abba a nyomorult krokodilba azt�n most meg itt vagyok, hogy nem lehet egy megf�radt embert b�k�ben hagyni.
- A lelkem? Na m�g csak azt nem, az m�r el van adva sajn�lom, keress valaki m�st akit ilyen l�lekmindens�ggel zaklathatsz. Na �n megyek.
*A l�lek nem tesz semmit.*
Kell neked annyi magic item :PP
(So tired of life)
(bro should've died 20+ times, after a while it just gets annoying)

This is giving me a headache
*Scorpio vigyora sz�lesebbre h�z�dik, de elt�nik bel�le a humor �s hat�rozottabb, �szint�bb tekintettel l�p egy l�p�st k�zelebb kettej�kh�z.*
� Biztos tudod te is, hogy **minden v�gyam** ezut�n v�gre biztons�gban letelepedni.
*Oldalra d�ntve a fej�t Tallulah szemeibe n�z, �gy folytatja.*
� Sosem �reztem m�g ennyire biztosnak magam abban, hogy v�gre minden v�gyam beteljes�tem. Hamar biztons�gban fogsz tudni minket!

Nem
:)
Wait there is a followup for it brb
Jajj de j� :D
(A krokodil az Ammit, vagy mi? XD)
*Can't waaaiiit* xD
Rem�lem cserben hagy az er�nk vagy idk xD
Nem
The 3 magic items I can possibly carry XD
And a magic infused weapon
certainly would be *very fun*
xdd
Oh no
This is worse than that xD

*I'm soo exciteeeed*
XDDD
<:squeeze:1255214410906075236>
Oh and ofc
Szerintem Ori megk�zel�ten� m�g aznap Yri�t lehet�leg Scorpiot�l k�l�n �s r�k�rdez hogy minden rendben van-e mostan�ban, nem �rz�kelt mag�n valami fur�t xd

This is not a square
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=2aUBeSJeWNRefqLc
Square has to have parallel sides
*i have to know if she knows*
*i don't wanna be the only one who knows, couldn't live with that*
Mondja Yria hogy persze minden rendben, �s nem igaz�n tud semmi furcs�r�l
<:oricry:1266108627366711368> <:oricry:1266108627366711368> <:oricry:1266108627366711368>
How tf did you think this will be okay? XD
*f u c k*
You **can't** call it a square
Period.
XD
(the art on the bag of holding/devouring looks like teeth if you are drunk enough xd)
(So how is her insight? xDD)
*Omg i actually had to use the knowledge of the math lessions?*
It wasn't a life or death situation tho, so...
<@282869456664002581> you're suddenly very silent xD

- [Q] Letelepedni?!? Akarod mondani, egy b�zis ahonnan megy�nk s�rk�nyt �lni, ugye?
I have 7 fucking message lines to jump between chill
� Igen, pontosan. :)
XDDDD

*Megk�nnyebb�lve hallgatja, hogy Sorcha lelke nem eml�kszik semmire abb�l ami a meggyilkol�sa ut�n t�rt�nt vele, �s �gy n�z ki nem is hagyott rajta sok nyomot a m�sik s�k.*
-Fel szeretn�m t�masztani �nt, �s a lelk�t szabadon ereszteni, hogy �jra �lhessen a csal�dj�val. �n nem akartam meg�lni, arra tal�n eml�kszik m�g... Az �n test�re jelenleg egy thaisili monostorban vigy�znak, mert valahogy m�g mag�n�l van... Azt hiszik meg�r�lt...
A square has several definitions
Technically a shape with 4 equal length sides and all corners being 90 degrees is sufficient to define a square
(as long as we don't do dumb shit like measuring the corners half inside angle half outside angle, or bend the sides xd)
(roll deception)
Tartom magam az �ll�spontomhoz xD
Ori rn: *immediate worry*
-r deception
*p a n i c*
I'd need to get up for that xd
Damn
Wait
Hmmm
You know what? No, 16 it is
(Annyit az�rt nem hazudik tho xD bizony gondolt Qan-Larra �s arra hogy el kell majd j�rnia s�rk�nyvad�szatokra xD)
(Half truths xD)
I mean if it's not shit she would notice cause Ori's charisma is shit so xD
- [Q] Aha! Az�rt nem tegnap sz�lettem, hogy itt m�g�ttem, a szem... tenyerem el�tt szervezkedj!
*Qan-Lar �k�lbe szorul egy pillanatra.*
- Els� s�rk�ny amit megl�tunk, sz�t kapjuk ahogy azt kell. Mindig megy�nk a te sz�ks�gleteid ut�n meg minden azt�n itt nekem soha semmi, csak hamis �g�retek.
- Uhm... minden rendben? Valami aggaszt azt l�tom.

Square :3
(Shut up and accept my gift)
� H�, pontosan tudom milyen az amikor semmilyen sz�ks�gleted nincs kiel�g�tve. Mindenk�pp el akarlak majd vinni s�rk�nyvad�szatokra, nem akarn�m hogy az t�rt�njen veled mint ami velem...
*Scorpio egy pillanatra �sszer�ncolja szem�ld�keit, de hamar igyekszik visszarendezni a von�sait semlegess�.*
(*I will never shut*)
Honk :3
The one you see on old bicycles
XD
*�s �k�lbe is szorul a keze.*
(*Yes*)
(XD)
(Eh le�rgad, nem jav�tom m�r ki xD)
� Meg nem az�rt, de �n is sz�vesen �jra fojtogatn�k meg harcoln�k �jra s�rk�nyokkal, mint a r�gi sz�p id�kben!
- Csak jussunk t�l ezen az ostromon �s minden rendben lesz... M�g ha nagyon megtisztel� is, n�ha olyan j� lenne ha nem rajtunk m�lna minden...
*Mondja kicsit a f�ldre f�lre n�zve.*
� Ott v�r minket az a Greatwyrm az egyik sziget sz�v�ben, m�g oda is el kell �m menn�nk!
(Not Scorpio trying to save the day xD)
- Meg�r�lni? Eh, legal�bb az is valami �j. Persze t�masz csak fel vagy micsoda azt�n ess�nk t�l ezen is. Puszta feketes�gben t�volabb utaztam mint �letemben, m�g ilyet. Azt�n azt mond meg, hogy mif�le okokb�l vagyunk egy piros erd�ben?
(note: az erd� nem piros xd)
(Damn. � k�pes l�tni l�lek form�ban? XD Scorpio nem volt k�pes ilyenre)
-Addig is fontos, hogy magabiztosak maradjatok. Musz�ly lesz kitartanatok m�g egy kis ideig. A j�v�nk rajtatok �ll. *Megint v�gign�z kettej�k�n �s halkan s�hajt egyet.* -Szeretn�k adni nektek valamit. Egy utols� aj�nd�k hogy jav�tsunk az es�lyeiteken �s az �n lelkiismeret is tiszta lesz. Elfogadj�tok?
(That's new)
- [Q] Hah! Egy greatwyrm? Finally a worthy opponent. Legyen h�t, de ha l�tunk egy s�rk�nyt tudod a dolgunk!
(I hope you can't wait for him to figure out that he can actually take control outside of just controlling himself momentarily here and there)
(not all spirits are created equal I guess (just like my memory xd))
(de mostm�r �gy lesz, � �gyis egy weirdo)
(anomaly)
*Vigasztal�an �tkarolja Scorpio Yria v�ll�t, de k�zben Tallulahra is figyel. Meg valami m�sra is, mintha hirtelen a figyelme megosztott lenne.*
� Tiszta lelkiismeret? Eddig is tiszta volt, csak seg�tett�l nek�nk, mindegy mennyire nem sz�vlelt�k egym�st kor�bban.
*S�hajt egyet.*
� De minden seg�ts�get elfogadunk.
(I can't wait xD)
*Yria is b�lint.*
- Mindenre sz�ks�g�nk lesz, Lacaine eszm�letlen er�s lesz...
� Egy valamit az�rt musz�j vagyok meg�g�rtetni veled.
� Elmegy�nk mindenk�pp majd a greatwyrm�rt, ok�s? �s elint�zz�k az els� s�rk�nyt is amivel tal�lkozunk, **ha** az a s�rk�ny chromatic. Rendben?
-Rendben h�t. Scorpio, k�rem a karod, Yria neked pedig a p�nc�lot.
- [Q] �s ha nem akkor csak hagyunk egy besti�t szabadon puszt�tani mint a m�ltkor?
*Pislog egyet de odany�jtja neki a bal, h�sv�r karj�t.*
*Enyhe fintorra h�zza a sz�ja jobb sark�t.*
- Nem hangzik t�l lelkesnek az �let�vel kapcsolatban... Egy�ltal�n milyen alkuval, vagy �ld�ssal lett ilyen strapab�r�?... Am�gy az erd� teljesen z�ld, h�la az isteneknek... Azt sem tudom, hogyan k�pes egyaltal�n l�tni... *Kicsit fejjebb emeli a lelket a kezeiben, hogy megvizsg�lhassa.*
- Uhm, pillanat.
*Mondja Yria miel�tt kimegy a kis shed-be a h�z mellett.*
*Egy r�pke gondolkod�s ut�n Scorpio ezzel v�laszol:*
� Tudod, ebben a jelen id�ben van egy t�rv�ny, hogy nem szabad b�ntani a metallic s�rk�nyokat, ha csak nincs j� okunk r�...
(B�rom ezt a tagot. XD A feles�ge depresszi�san gy�szol, � meg k�zben: �gy n�z ki m�r megint �lek... Eh...)
-A...m�sikat.
-Levehet�, nem?)
� Qan-Lart? H�t... nem tudom, musz�j levenni?
-H�t...ha nem zavar �gy is megcsin�lhatom, hogy rajtad van. Legal�bb tudok valakivel besz�lgetni addig.
- [Q] Mi Shaperek vagyunk, mi vagyunk a t�rv�ny, l�tom sokat felejtett�l, de ne sajn�ld majd seg�tek eml�kezni dolgokra n�zd.
*Scorpio l�t�sa hirtelen els�t�t�l �s a Nexus t�rk�p szob�j�ban tal�lja mag�t r�gi �nmagak�nt, shaperek veszik k�rbe az asztalt, egyik�k tartja Qan-Lart (you) mag�n�l. A vision nem a legtiszt�bb de �ppen arr�l besz�lnek, hogy, hogyan fognak egy greatwyrm-�t belecsalni az antimagic k�d egy elk�l�n�tett r�sz�be itt lent Mulandir alatt miel�tt hozz� cseppentenek a k�dh�z egy keveset valamib�l, hogy azonnal meg�lj�k a d�g�t.*
*Majd a vision v�get �r.*
(� is depis csak m�shogy nyilv�nul meg)
� Engem nem zavar. De ha harap, az nem �n vagyok! Egy kicsit morcos �ppen...
*Viccel�dik, de hangj�ban �rezni hogy � maga annyira nem tartja viccesnek a szavait.*
*Majd Scorpio egy pillanatra ki-phase-el.*
(xd)
(Yeah, it's just funny in a way xd)
*Pislogva n�zi, hogy mi t�rt�nik.* -H�t...j�... *Ha Yria is visszat�r a v�rtj�vel, megk�sz�ni �s meg�leli a l�nyt.* -Ha szeretn�d gyere vel�nk, de el fog tartani egy darabig. Ostrom kezdet�re v�gzek rem�lhet�leg.
- H�t magam sem tudom, k�t�ttem valami �tkozott pactetet, hogy mindig szerencs�m lesz, leg balszerencs�sebb napom volt �letemben. Ha r�m hallgatsz nem k�tsz pactet d�monokkal!
- Mit besz�lsz teljesen z�ld meg hogyan l�tok, itt �llok melletted �s n�zd csak ezt a f�t, olyan piros nem is tudom hogy nem l�ngol. Hmm, vajon melegnek, meleg-e...
*Hirtelen az Ardenhez legk�zelebbi fa spontaneously kigyullad.*
*Scorpio a vision ut�n egy kicsit feld�ltabb lesz, kezdi elvesz�teni a t�relm�t.*
� Figyelj, tudom hogy neh�z lesz ezt most elfogadni, de m�r nem a Shaperek uralj�k a tartom�nyokat, �s alig egy-k�t *f�l*-Shaper s�t�l a felsz�nen! M�r nem mi alkotjuk a t�rv�nyeket!
� De legyen! Ha szeretn�d, vakon meg�lhetj�k a k�vetkez� s�rk�nyt. De ha elkapnak, elvesznek t�ged t�lem, �s elz�rnak az id�k v�gezet�ig egy s�t�t, m�gi�val k�rbez�rt kis rekeszbe hogy ott rohadjon meg az �p elm�d, akkor nagyon sz�vesen elmegyek veled levad�szni az �sszes l�tez� s�rk�nyt!
*Megvakarja tark�j�t mik�zben h�zza a sz�j�t picit.*
- Nos.. Igen... �s �gy v�lem �rdemes tudnod r�la, mert lehet v�ltoztat azon hogy vel�nk akarn�l-e j�nni t�nyleg..
*Egyik l�b�r�l a m�sikra helyezi �t s�ly�t, nem tudv�n pontosan hogy a k�vetkez� inform�ci�t hogyan fejezze ki.*
- Uhh.. Egy �j l�lek fejl�dik benned... �s ha nem megsz�llt valami akkor..
*N�z Yri�ra rem�lve hogy �rti hova akar kilyukadni.*
(az erd� el�gg� eg�szs�gesnek t�nik, hogy nem fog terjedni probably)
(<:zorablush:1021403403768844308><:oricry:1266108627366711368>)
*Miut�n Scorpio �szhez t�r, feld�ltan f�jtat egyet ahogy Qan-Lart b�mulja.*
(Ori kilyukad?)
(lehet xDD)
*Yria l�tszik, hogy gondolkozik egy darabig, majd elpirosul az arca.* ~~(�s �t v�ltozik egy pitfiend-d�)~~
- Oh... uhm, tudja ezt... b�rki m�s?
(dicey knows xDD)
-Minden rendben?
- [Q] Nem a t�rv�ny el�l futsz m�r t�bb mint egy �ve? �gy mondod, mintha csak �gy el tudn�nak kapni minket... Mindketten Shaper eredet�ek vagyunk, nincs senki a vil�gon aki meg tud minket �ll�tani!
(Spicy item)
*Scorpio frusztr�ltan megpr�b�lja mind az �sszes 12 milli� �v�nek s�t�t napjainak eml�k�t megmutatni Qan-Larnak.*
(*Ha siker�l: � Ezt szeretn�d?*)
(Nika knew exactly how old Qan-Lar was, I told her enough stories about it xd)
(I'm living for this xD)
(I love this convo xD)
Just to like all 4 of the rp-s I'm running: I'm off to cook lunch xd
Okay
- �rd�g�kkel. *F�zi hozz� r�viden, amikor alkuk�t�sr�l van sz�. Csak megr�zza a fej�t ahogy a halfling ragaszkodik a piros f�s n�zet�hez, majd amikor ut�na n�z, kiguvadnak szemei ahogy l�ngba borul. Azonnal visszah�zza mag�hoz a lelket, �s elrakja am�g elh�r�tja a vesz�lyt. Miut�n ezt gyorsan lerendezte, a  kulacs�ban l�v� v�zzel �titatja egyik pokr�c�t, azzal igyekszik kialv�sra b�rni a l�ngokat. Rem�li, nem �ppen egy treant, b�r �gy se �r�l az esetnek.*
� Fogjuk r�. Neh�z egy fiatal, makacs Shapernek megmagyar�zni hogy m�k�dik a 12 milli� �vvel a saj�t idej�k �s vil�guk ut�ni vil�g.
*Frusztr�ltan leveszi tekintet�t a karr�l, majd ism�t Tallulahra n�z. Nem t�nik �gy hogy b�rkire is m�rges lenne, de az�rt a j�kedv elp�rolgott bel�le.*
� Kicsit neh�z �gy megv�deni a bajt�l hogy nem tapasztalta meg � maga a bajt.
- H�t ha te nem tudtad �s �gy nem tudtad mondani m�snak.. �n meg csak most l�ttam nem r�g �s nem mondtam senkinek... Nem hiszem hogy m�s tudn�. Ha csak nem l�tnak �gy mint �n, de olyanr�l nem tudok a k�zel�nkben..
*Kis sz�netet tart.*
- El�sz�r mindenk�pp neked akartam sz�lni hisz.. �rted... De most a k�rd�s az hogy biztos akarsz-e �gy harcolni, meg persze.. sz�lni m�snak is...?

Okay szerintem ide is bedobom mert ez gy�ny�r� xD
Szoval megkaptam az utols� nagaka boonom (i think it is, yes xD), ami azt adja hogy 5 spellem kb b�rhogy lecser�lhetek olyanra, amit ismerhetek a a fix list�kb�l
�gy n�z ki a terv xD
(it wasn't really the planned last boon, this was just a response to your plea)
(OH YOU SAY I STILL HAVE ONE LAST BOON TO GET? UWU????)
(XD)
Note to self:
Don't forget to tell the juicy info about the bbeg before we begin our way to the siege
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
(Is taking control over him would be the charmed condition? Because he's immune to being charmed xD)
(it's posession)
(I know, but would his charm immunity count in this case?)
(*especially cuz it comes from another artifact* xD)
(Just interested if he could be possessed or not)
- Ah, nem tudtam mikor vetted �szre... �hm, szerintem jobb ha nem tudja senki nem szeretn�m, hogy *valaki* emiatt nem akarna engem a csatat�ren, nem foglak itt a v�g�n cserben hagyni titeket.
(Hmmm)
(Posession is not giving charmed condition yeah?)
(he definitely can be posessed)
(Yeah yeah n�zek ut�na k�zben xD)
(Anyway, my Cha saves are still godly)
- Na megint fekete minden, szuper... egy kis csend legal�bb...
*Arden sikeresen eloltja a f�t miel�tt a l�ngok b�rhova elterjedn�nek, b�r a pokr�c j� kormos lett t�le.*
� Nincs senki aki meg tud �ll�tani? Csak n�zz a relayre �s a fogyatkoz� er�re benne, n�zz arra a Shaperre aki most eszm�letlen�l fekszik itt a v�rosban! �t is "elkapt�k". �s � is egy Shaper. Mint mi.
� �n m�r r�g megtanultam hogy nem vagyunk mindenhat�k. Ebben a vil�gban m�r nem. Er�sek lehet�nk, de nem csak mi l�tez�nk m�r. �s igenis, 12 milli� �v alatt a vil�g megv�ltozik �s alkalmazkodik, �s ez�rt nem mindegy, hogy eszetlen�l megy�nk-e gyilkol�szni vagy nem.
� Hallgass m�r egy kicsit r�m is! Vagy mindenk�pp ugyan�gy szeretn�l meg�rlel�dni az id� �ltal, mint ahogy az el�z� Qan-Lar tette?
� �rtsd meg, nem eltiltani akarlak a l�tez�sed oka el�l �s a v�gyaidt�l, csak szeretn�m �vatosan elj�rva val�ra v�ltani neked azokat.
*Ha k�pes lenne mend-et �s prestidigitation-t var�zsolni, pillanatok alatt helyrehozhatn� a pokr�cot �s a ruh�it is, nem k�ne mindig Ori idej�t h�znia ilyenekkel, gondolja. Most egyel�re csak az alkarj�ra bor�tva tartja, azt�n majd kiteregeti valahov� sz�radni. Megsz�l�tja a halflingot a tudat�n kereszt�l.*
- Bocs�nat, de nem akarom terjeszteni a t�zet... Am�gy, ha annyira zavarja ez a t�lszerencs�s �tka, tal�n tudunk keresni valakit aki seg�thet. Niamhot ismeri, ugye?
- A k�r�lm�nyeket figyelembe v�ve nem mondan�m cserben hagy�snak ha nem j�nn�l a harcba.. De a te d�nt�sed v�g�lis, ahogy az is hogy kinek mondod el... �s ha mindenk�pp j�nn�l harcolni �gy meg�rtem hogy nem akarsz *neki* sz�lni...
*B�lint p�rat ink�bb csak mag�nak.*
- Csak l�gy nagyon �vatos, ellenfel�nk ismer minket, c�lkeresztben lesz�nk k�pess�geink miatt... Maradjunk �letben ha lehet, ok�? 
*Nevet egyet f�j�n majd halv�nyan elmosolyodik.*

*Remember when you said Ori is constantly hearing voices? The voices are... gone, for the first time in 14 years there is no "background noise", just his own thoughts.*
(I remembered from your backstory :P)
- [S] I... I'll be fine, I just... never felt like this in my life, so much quiet... so much knowledge gone...
- [S] I'm not hopeful about recovering the souls, although I don't know what happens with them
- [S] Not many stayed in the city right? The whole place might collapse with the Nexus not being operational, but I can't check it anymore... cus...
- [S] yea...
- [S] The central building, the Nexus itself can collapse
- [S] I just don't know how integrally the rest of the city is connected to it
*Sylmaris quite winded:*
- I'm busy with it right now. There is just a huge bottomless pit in place of the capital building! Very few casualties so far.

Scorpio a halacska
Yria a blue birdy
:>

.
Btw akkor az Umbra az tud tal�lni vev�t p�r g�lemre �s szerezni egy ring of regenerationt?
Nem kell gyorsan
I mean csak ki tudnak menteni p�rat xD
B�r
Az omlott be el�sz�r
Nvm then xD
*forget the question*
XD
(sry xd)
*eeeeh*
its fiiiiine xdd
-r 1d6
Find the kitty
There the little baby is :3
<@463641084971712514>
Sz�val van egy ranger�nk a b�rd �s a barb�r mell�?
Ki a b�rd? O.O
The Prince?
H�t nem a cuki?
De a Cuki...
Ya know
Att�l m�g maradhat class-ja
H�t
Att�l m�g az
Yeah
He deserves it
He won't just get erased
Yeah you're right
Its not like out tpks xdd
*our
Tho nem tudom hogy b�rd lenne-e
Cuki? Hmmm
Some high dex high cha thing for sure
Sorcerer?
M�g warlockon gondolkodtam
Look at the patrons xD

XD Kbitty
Kbitty
Celestial cuz he was divine
Or fiend cuz Fannika
Lol xD
But yea szerintem Cuki egy warlock lenne ink�bb, divine most likely
We called him Prince for a reason
*The prince of darkness*
I'd say sorcerer if pathfinder applied cuz that has a "Royal bloodline" subclass
Hmm
I mean sorcerer could work too
Azt�n majd sz�p lassan t�bb is lesz xD majd a Gan� mell� szeretn�k egy m�sik macsekot hozni hogy ne legyen egyed�l
Annak biztos �r�lne

*Lesz kit terroriz�lni am�g nem leszel otthon* XD
Yes
Oh god szeg�ny kismacska
*Lesz kivel egy�tt rombolni amig nem leszek otthon*
Gandalf might be a bit too rough at first xD
XD naah, az elej�n �gyse hagyn�m magukra �ket
Figyu, nem felt�tlen�l kell egy p�r hetes kiscic�t szerezni mell� XD
Yeah
Also. It's not a good idea to just let them be as soon as you bring home the second one.
Actually gondolkodtam azon is hogy egy 1-2 �ves macsk�t hozni mell�
Yea i know
Ha egy j�t�kosat tal�lsz, az lehet jobb lenne neki. Gandalf is... Well he's a full package xD
(of pure bullshit)
Els�sorban egy igazi macsk�t akarok melle xD
<:oricry:1266108627366711368> <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
Yeaaaa
Nagyobb vagy kissebb test�re p�ly�zn�l?
Az annyira nem fontos r�szemr�l, csak legyen r�vidsz�r�
Olyat szeretn�k aki meg tudja mutatni a Gandalfnak hogy hogyan kell macsk�nak lenni
*A siberian tiger will do*
Might have a chance against Gandalf
***Might***
Sz�val legyen finesse lopkodni XD
<@520697326679883808> heh, good luck
Why
Did Anna
Got pinged
Wtf discord
XD
XDDD
Gandalf already knows how te be a cat.
His own kind of cat
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
*�n majd megmutatom a Gandalfnak, how to cat*
You probably had it typed out and forgot
Discord saves everything you write even on full restarts
It bamboozled me multiple times as.well
I mean... xD
Everything except when it doesn't feel like it
Yea. Weird system
One day I'll draw one too
Annyit tudok, hogy ha elmegy a neted nem ment. Viszont ha le�rsz valamit �s kil�psz a chatb�l elmenzi piszkozatnak
*Meanwhile Grei*
Leoris would be almost the same just one armored one not
But Erin. Oh god
Before trauma:<:highgrei:1237378027210674256> 
With trauma: <:highgrei:1237378027210674256> 
With even more trauma: <:highgrei:1237378027210674256>
XDDDDD
*NOW GO DRAW GUYS*
Nah
Once I will have the will
Amikor v�gre be�zemeltetem a rajztabomat
Then, finally I will not be restrained by the size of paper
Okay this got me thinking oh no
I will draw a nice smooth Arden, the current Arden, and devil Arden in his ultimate form

*New music video*
XDDD
I don't know why I haven't done it yet xd
I just look at it and it's there and I'm like... *Don't look at me like that* XD
how long have you had it for? XD
Years
xd
It would be easy to set up, I'm sure
It takes about 10 minutes to get it going xD
Just think about it >:)
*then draaaaw*
https://youtu.be/Fc1P-AEaEp8?si=p011fQZcT7IvDTFj
It takes longer to get used to the art program of yiur choice xD
Yeah
Asszem a Krit�t szedtem le anno
Legal�bb tudok tan�csot k�rni ha valami nem menne
<:UwU:959931778905276456>
Yeah, �gi a krita pro xD
<:idek:694605001502228540>
I'm a procreate pro xD
Maybe I will do it today
I'm a Pycharm pro
But right now, I require sustenance
Van 50 000 art program
Majd amikor m�r eljutok a setup-ig, ut�na megn�zegetek p�rat ha valamelyik annyira nem t�nik k�zenfekv�nek
And then maybe I can finally art again
This time fully digitized
Dw abb�l kb 49 995 �gyis fizet�s xD
True XD
*I'll just draw in MS Paint* XD
*Honestly*
*My good old friend Paint*
Fuck yea xD
R�gen nagyon sokat rajzoltam abban
Ilyen �ltal�nos iskol�s koromban
A lin�metsz�shez is megj�tt mostans�g a kedvem
Van nagyimn�l m�g egy nagyobb darab lin�
Abb�l lehetne p�rat k�sz�teni
Lenyomatni nem tudom hol tudn�m azt amit csin�lok
De az igaz�b�l mell�kes
Bem�sz b�l�ba xD
Gondoltam r�, de az milyen m�r XD
I mean u can also probably rolling pin or heavy book the fucker xD
*I'll just lay on it* XD
*I'll just stand on it menacingly*
<:point:951578243415302235>
�*Doesn�t look like a camp*�
Well, cus it�s an attempted forest fire. It�s just that.. noone explained him that he needs to put the fire closer to the wood
XDD
XDDDD
Thank u UwU

<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
I'll throw this here as well
I love how in so many adventure books of TTRPGs the illustrators don't get the text they are supposed to illustrate so we have things like this:
"And then the ocean explodes behind Gorum, a foaming wall of water rising up behind him. From this unimaginably vast plume, a crimson blade scythes out and plunges through Gorum�s back, piercing him through the chest to emerge in a spray of metallic shrapnel."
https://preview.redd.it/stunts-like-this-is-why-calistria-is-no-longer-invited-to-v0-r5vxz12ufhwd1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b48d39487e477da026c0238451369bfaef464f6
Ah yes
Stabbed in the back I see
"Crimson"
*everything blue*
Cuz well
they are really really far away
It doesn't even look like if it wanted to be crimson xD
Only the rain has some spark of red
As an artist and someone-who-can-illustrate, i'm dizzy from this xD
They are in the sky at the horizon at night
if that makes sense
I
I ughh...
No for me this picture is not for this description xD
Where's the exploding ocean? The metallic shrapnel thing (idek what that is tbh xD)?
But cool art nonetheless :D
oh wait no
just found something that makes this worse
the art came first
XD
Ah god...
XD
god damn
TTRPG GAME WRITERS, PLEASE

can I be a writer for Paizo?
maybe
????????????????????????????

Ohno felvette a csukj�t
Oh no, betolta az edgy korean model p�zt XD
Nah that's just edgy scorpio xD. More trauma would be the one where he lost the control over Aren and is forever trapped in someone who kills the party one by one.
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>

(also just honorable mention: that username xd)
why he slutty tho?
pretty boy
He was always that way
With or without trauma, he is always somewhat slutty
<:UwU:959931778905276456>
yes
Face so squishable
That's another kind of trauma yes :3
But this ain't about Aren, this is purely about Scorpio

There is a new scam going around for data fishing. Scammers can call from randomly generated phone numbers, this can be *anyone's* number and ask for all kinds of personal info / run other scams.
For example people can get scam calls from your phone number, or you could get a scam call from an actual support line number, etc.

Be careful, as well as tell and explain to the older generation

*Arden tal�l n�h�ny ritk�bb n�v�nyt az erd�ben, tal�l egy sz�ll t�zr�zs�t (fire resi potion ingredients) a f�n�l ami megperzsel�d�tt. S egy kicsit t�volabb n�h�ny �giszemerc�t egy fa �gair�l l�gva amib�l j� kis feather fall potit lehet csin�lni.*
*A csal�d l�tszik, hogy nem l�p�dik meg t�ls�gosan arr�l, hogy mif�le csoporttal t�lt�d az id�det. Niamh mondja, hogy "sz�gyen lenne egy Purity papn�nek ha nem tudn�, hogy psion j�r a faluja k�rny�k�n".

Miut�n ezeket megtette, lepakolja �ket a sz�ll�s�n, azt�n tovahalad a csal�dj�hoz, ott seg�dkezik, tan�tja Aithnet tov�bbra is, megpr�b�lja eladni Rowannek is azzal, hogy ,,A kalandoroknak l�tfontoss�g� tudni ilyeneket, m�sk�l�nben lehet odavesznek egy csapd�ban amib�l a kijut�suk kulcsa a falra van v�sve".

I'll be honest I would say there are better Scorpio related things to spend money on
I would get a high quality print of one of your arts you made
if I were u
I ugh... i was never a fan of prints, pieces of fancy paper that has art on it
I could print things like these for myself too you just need to know the settings of your printer (i've printed many high-quality pictures for myself already)
I dunno
I'll be honest, i really want something that's him. Only him. The character
A plushie, a statuette, something else tho idk what
I want him made into real life that actually looks like him and not my pathetic attemp at making a crochet plushie of him xd

*easy*
You are Roknar, a powerful unarmed + shield brawler who accidentally got infused with a Divine Spark and became an Exemplar. (lvl1)

You are in the face of an enemy as your party banters with them, diplomacy breaks down so combat it is
You roll init, and free action shift your Spark into your bracers activating the Fetching Bangles, which gives you a passive that forces enemies to make a Will save if they want to move away from you or they lose the action.
The Bandit captain fails and decides to instead just attack you from the last two actions he has, one misses, one hits, you are fine, you were hit by worse even before you carried a piece of godhood.

The other thug reaches your cleric and messes them up

the cleric drops a Runic Body on you to give +1 Striking (aka +1 to hit and +1 dmg die) on your unarmed attacks

you start your turn
you Transcend the Fetching Bangles, forcing the thug to succeed a will save or be pulled within 20 ft of you, enemy fails, now you have both peeps attention. Transcend also forces you to move your spark, you gladly move it to your own hands activating Hands of the Wildling, giving you a passive 1 spirit splash dmg per weapon die, due to striking that's 2
so you make an unarmed attack on the thug, hoping to get them out of the fight early
crit them, you deal your good old (2d4+4)*2 dmg to them plus 2 splash dmg to both the thug and the captain
and as your last action you shift your Spark into your shield activating the passive of the Mirrored Aegis which gives you and your allies within 15 ft. +1 status bonus to AC

Is this pf?
yep
the new class
called Exemplar
who's basically a guy who somehow has a tiny Divine Spark with them
They he goes home and as he returns he realises his entire family was murdered while he had a lovely vacation ^^
We have the plot for next year's inktober xD
Like
As a part of them or attached to them somehow?
Keress r�. Its really good
Creamy
H�labda
Sorry

Hogy lett v�ge a sessionnek?
basically, as the new book "War of Immortals" got released one of the major deities called Gorum, God of Battle, Our Lord in Iron dies. And his blood rains on Golarion, some of his blood still carrying his divine essence empowers a few lucky people granting them powers akin to divinity itself. These people are called the Exemplars
Asking for a friend
Ah so
I see
Sounds really cool
How did the god die??
they can be built pretty versitally, basically any kind of martial works for them
for example you can be a big disruptor powerhouse as I showed above, they can also go for ranged or thrown weapons, or maybe you try to be sneaky

how does a big divine guy sneak?
well simple, you slash at the sun, killing it, and now nobody can see you moving around
Woow
He was a true neutral deity, and realized that war started be used for evil and that this started to change him as well. He didn't want to be an evil deity, so he deiceded to challange another god, Rovagug, The Rough Beast, Assassin of Gods, The Unmaker to a duel, thinking that he either wins and at least rids the world of this filth of a god, or loses and goes out in valiant battle. Well he lost

oh other fun thing about the Exemplar, on certain levels you gain epithets
lvl1:
Diocles

# Root Epithet (lvl3)
You begin to shape the potential of your divine spark. You come to bear an epithet - a word or phrase that seems to always stick in the mind of those describing you.
[...] (it also grants ability based on the epithet)
Choose one:
The Brave
The Cunning
The Deft
The Proud
The Mournful
The Radiant

Diocles the Cunning

# Dominion Epithet (lvl7)
Your divinity has grown in power along with your deeds, allowing you to begin claiming dominion over aspects of creation.
[...] (grants ability based on the epithet)
Choose one:
Born of the Bones of the Earth
Dancer in the Seasons
Of Verse Unbroken
Peerless under Heaven
Restless as the Tide
Whose Cry is Thunder

Diocles the Cunning, Peerless under Heaven

# Sovereignty Epithet (lvl15)
The litany of heroic deeds left in your wake has caused your divine spark to blaze bright enough that it now illuminates your legacy.
[...] (grants ability based on the epithet)
Healer of the World
Teacher of Heroes
The Last Ruler
Thief of Moonlight

Diocles the Cunning, Peerless under Heaven, Thief of Moonlight
-------
OMG there is a feat that you can command your Ikons to reman motionless.
While motionless the Ikon need 8000 pounds of pressure applied to them to be moved, they can also however be moved with a successful Atheltics check against your class DC.
You can also release an Ikon above an adjacent prone enemy and if you do they need a check to successfully stand up or move away from thei square and you can draw it back to your hand as another action if you wish
also the ikon flies back to your hand if the enemy manages to stand up
**THIS IS A LVL4 FEAT**
xD
So this is gonna be like a session 0! We still have quite a few things to do before we can begin proper. I also will *probably* need to get going an hour after we start or so sadly, but in that time we can do everything we need to do.
Sune
Sune the Proud
Sune the Proud, Born of the Bones of the Earth, Teacher of Heroes

We need to play drakkenheim again, guyy
And before that, I said it on voice
Drakkenheim... but in pf2e? XD
Idc i just wanna play it again...THANKS ENDRE
I want to feels
It might come up, one of the few campaigns I'd be alright re-running, but no promises
For now I drop back to running 1 thing on the server as I was asked to leave space for the other gms
But if nobody picks that space up I'll find smth to run
I would love to pick up something
But only in next spring
Next spring as in 2026 spring or?
XD bruh
Look, I'm on 3 hrs of sleep ( https://discord.com/channels/562373378967732226/1032650247622639686/1301806719755616288) deal with me here
Btw what? Xd
Drakkenheim cucc m�g asszem azel�ttr�l hogy csatlakozt�l
Kerestek egy Melinda nev� b�rgyilkost
�s nem esett le nekik, hogy a criminal syndicate Blackjack Mel nev� contactja az xd
Ahh
Yeah
We were in out theories way too deep
It was very fun to watch
I wanna play it again
So i can actually become the king
Btw I read some of my old character backstories and just... Wow. Do even I know english? XD
Do you English bro?
What if someone else wants to try that path as well? \:D
(not me tho. I already have a destined king somewhere else)
XD
Maybe even 2 if nobody wants to ruler in kingmaker xD
No
Yes
Listen, eddig egyik kamp�nyban sem siker�lt el�rnem a c�ljaimat �gy ahogy szerettem volna
Olyan temp�ban �s m�dszerekkel ahogy terveztem
Lemme have my wishes just once xd
*party decides to go Queen's Men route, absolutely destroying the chance for a stable kingdom*
XD
Nekem mindegy csak szeretn�m ha a karakterem olyan karrier� lenne mint a karakterek most pobban
Mert eddig ugye vagy sajnos sz�netelve lettek a kamp�nyok, vagy nem lett befejezve norm�lisan
I just want to give you one tip to do this
Please
Try not to sabotage yourself
And ya know... Tails exists, you play there and you can achieve huge things with Hikaru too
And if you grow to like him so much, we could even transfer him into FR
Azt mondtad legk�zelebb szeretn�d ha... Wait. Queen's Men + Silver Order lenne a kamp�ny?
That's a hell of a combo but Silver Order isn't against outsourcing some work I'm sure
They are on a mission. If there is a way to make it easier....
Greater good and all
I'd love to play Zinzana in a political campaign
I wont xd
I want to be more laid back on my charavter making and playing as well
PoB became insane, I don't know if I'll ever be able to top it but I'll do my best
Queen Zinzana of Westem�r?
Do you want your vampire girl to be ....
# GERMAN
Nah, i don't want her to be a queen nor a german
XD
Vampirism in drakkenheim, hm
Just switching some thing about rhe infection or the stone itself could change big things about the campaign
Oh yea I'd definitely change some core things
And biggest change, I'll make the inner city actually exhausting
You're gonna keep travel times? You monster
I'd want Zinzana to make their family greater in power and become the next head
This would be her ultimate goal
Yea, I literally forgot about it until mid campaign last time
We talked about it yes
But it would have been a big tone shift too late
Yea
*Not the Zassricrith bladesingers becoming the next royal guards*
XD
Would it work in a world where travel to/from fr at most have been accidental?
I mean, the family could be plopped into any setting
The next... Queen's Men you say?
:)
Alr
They just need a creepy gothic castle
Like germany
With alien radiation
And supercancer
XDDDD
Yeah fair
But oh god their family (tree) is detailed
The backstory is loooong xD
Full of NPCs a DM can abuse
With history
*Looking at you Zinzana granny*
I can implement npc-s but definitely not many as there is more than enough already in drakkenheim xd
Granny would be scary. She'd rock your shit in general. And now put supercancer based mutations on her with spaceradiation magic.
Fair, fair
Nightmare fuel
Yeah basically granny Zinzana was the family's reformer
Btw, the mist denies sunlight sensitivity, full on vampire could chill on the street easily
Ah hek ye
*full kn vampire Zassricriths* xD
I still love that that was the least of her concerns. She only did it cuz she had nothing else to do. Her main thing was get as strong as you can to spite everyone
But nah, they'r dhampirs
Yes xD that woman was a menace
Ohno
I love how half of the Zassricrith history is granny Zinzana herself xD
The family would be nowhere if it wasn't
Yep
Mutant vampire? :3
With the haze empowering undead anyways
Don't tempt me
Stop giving yourself ideas
*Phuck*
Now we have to worry about cancer bites as well
I'm gonna become drakkenheim's greatest vampire lord royal guard <a:hellmage_emilyyeh:833496986657357824>
*I'll be the head of the next megacorporation*
<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
Ah how fun it's be if i got to be the owner of the academy
<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
Royal Guard, Megacorpo and academy leader?
Hey yes
Make your choice woman, you can't be everything at the same time xD
Literally harder task than becoming the king
Aww :c
Fair. The throne is actually empty
The academy seat is open big time
BUT
Endre can switch things around for the fun of it \:D
If I run it, I will
I'd just want the family to become powerful and/or very influental
Like actually making this small noble family into something *big*
Even getting one of the main roles under the king will do that
Yes
*But i'd need to figure out how to play a bladesinger without actually playing the bladesinger*
:cccc
True gishes are hard
I know
I just don't want to play the wizard xd
~~pf2e magus, easy~~
Maybe I can handcraft some subclass for u on smth
:D
<a:AAAA:1094704045878427769>

Also btw, that means Lucretia is against the party :3

Whats going on?
*Lucretia going*
https://tenor.com/view/argentina-croatia-take-off-bandwagon-fan-clap-gif-12051103
Plot twist: Lucretia is Granny Zinzana in disguise
Lucretia has a very set and important backstory, so probs not xd
:c
Flaming Fist Bucco wtf???
She could be french too, just saying
I'm not sure if that's any better
Trinit as a Lantern
Juno as a Queens Man
Csiperke as Falking Fire
Csiperke didn't even get to do Queen's Men stuff in the og run
The team synergy wasn't right for it
Max. akkor ha mindenki h�ta m�g�tt pr�b�lkoztam volna vele, de

Okay, maybe 2 missions
But that's not much
So what's up with Secret Santa?
Im kinda against it but perhaps
If you don't want to, you can just not take part
Ye
Anyone can opt out if they don't wanna
I kinda wanna
Dudes and dudettes and everyone inbetween: Witch it is free on epic games. Get it now
Soo
What's the issue?
Just unsure?
I guess the fear of not knowing who you get, afraid of getting a person he doesn't want
*Gambling be like*
Money and ideas
B�r most nem lesz kevin aki 30kt k�lt�tt r� legut�bb xddd
If the person doesn't tell what they'd want imma just get them chocolate xDD

L�tni
Okay good
Sry a r�gi channelt olvastam �ppen xD
Nice
Ah xD
Boop
*I'm in*
*Nice*
Imma start then
Go ahead :3
Let me see
I like any and all chocolate with *n o* liquid filling, 
fun earrings with weird dangles (like dragons, dinos, bottles etc.), 
clothes with fun prints (like socks with cats or smth, shirt with mushrooms, etc.), 
art of my character just as is or printed on stuff (I don't have space for mugs tho so maybe no mugs xD), 
new dice are always welcome,
 strange smallish plushies (like of crabs, parrots, etc.)
(I read socks as cocks)
XD
*I mean*
please don't "cocks with cats or smt"
Nah I like choosing those myself sry xD
I shall also make a guide for the earnings I prefer
Earnings?
Yes xD
I don't think a living wage would fit into out 5k budget
Aw damn
Oh well
So earrings it is then xD
B�rig�nyt �rok nektek
Steam-en ahogy eln�zem van p�r j�t�k, ami �ppen 5000 Ft k�rny�k�n, vagy alatta van m�g teljes �ron is: Dredge: The Iron Rig, vagy Mo: Astray, vagy Dap, vagy Bleak Sword DX


<:idek:694605001502228540>
What kinda earrings face the same direction? That's cursed
**For me it's the following:**
- First things first, please don't buy me food or sweets, i'm on a strict diet so likely nothing one'd give would be consumed :c
*However* if one do choose to buy me sweets, then please not something pure-chocolate, rather something coated with chocolate that has no fruity stuff in it (either toffefee or (double)chocolate pocky is what i consume if you need names, but these are relatively expensive :P)
- Anything handmade will receive lots of love, especially if it's related to one of my characters or arts
- Custom design/printed wearables like shirts and stuff, or just these with fun designs
- Handmade stuff
- BOOKS. But i know yall don't know what books i'd read, so gift cards to bookshops are better, so nobody would have to stress on choosing the best book and whether i'd like it or not - also, these gift cards and books in general are expensive, so if one chooses this option, then choose this option **only**
- Handmade stuff
- Dice are always welcome, same as �gi :3
- Handmade stuff
- Sketchbooks :3 preferably empty ones
- Bitchboyish asian men, real of fictional, either works
-Handmade stuff

And nothing else comes to my mind, so... xD that's all
Let me tell u
*A metric-fuck-ton of them*
xd
Yep
We should bring u Asian men?
*Yes pls*
xD
I don't think we can get those under 5k xDD
(You could also just give us a list of books you'd like. I would do the same but most books I want are above 5000)
Yes, but that is exactly why i don't give a list cuz most books on my list are 6k+
And i often impulebuy books
Saddies
I have a feeling u like handmade stuff
<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378> <:VeryHmm:963844125155811378> <:VeryHmm:963844125155811378> <:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>

I know
You'll suffer
I kniw
But i like the look of it
The steampunk and doll stuff
dont
its one of the harder soulslike
you'll just suffer
I heard mixed reviews, some says it's easier, some says it's harder
And there's an "EasyMode" mod somewhere for it xD
De lehet nem veszem meg, hanem gamepass-el kipr�b�lom
Mindenk�pp ki akarom pr�b�lni mert nagyon �rdekel
*De a f@szom hogy a j�t�kok amik �rdekeln�nek mind nehezek*

there is no like easy mod... its more like making the game less unforgiving
its partof their desing to be hard
but if you can find joy in overcoming obstickles
its a damn good one
I find joy in aesthetics, worldbuilding and story xD
And i like the aesthetics of this one
but to find these you need to learn some skill
dodging, learning attack patterns
but hey
you do you
i think is worth it
if you are not willing to give up
You played it?
yeah
Apart from it's difficulty, you say it's a worth-it game, yes?
yes
its a damn good game
Then i think i'll buy the gamepass, it's cheaper than it's full price and i can still enjoy the full game
And *if* i don't give up, i might buy it

Guys that witch it night was so good pls let's repeat it again sometime this week, doesn't have to be at night just let's play together the official servers are now open again we could go to one
Sure I'm in



I have a science fantasy setting where ftl works by opening a hole into fairyland, which basically made of shortcuts if you know which way to go. Risks include getting lost and ending up somewhere else, or getting attacked by fae who don't appreciate people trespassing. The ships are shielded with iron.
Dearest creature in creation,
Study English pronunciation.
I will teach you in my verse
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.
I will keep you, Suzy, busy,
Make your head with heat grow dizzy.
Tear in eye, your dress will tear.
So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.
Just compare heart, beard, and heard,
Dies and diet, lord and word,
Sword and sward, retain and Britain.
(Mind the latter, how it�s written.)
Now I surely will not plague you
With such words as plaque and ague.
But be careful how you speak:
Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;
Cloven, oven, how and low,
Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.
Hear me say, devoid of trickery,
Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,
Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,
Exiles, similes, and reviles;
Scholar, vicar, and cigar,
Solar, mica, war and far;
One, anemone, Balmoral,
Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;
Gertrude, German, wind and mind,
Scene, Melpomene, mankind.
Billet does not rhyme with ballet,
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.
Blood and flood are not like food,
Nor is mould like should and would.
Viscous, viscount, load and broad,
Toward, to forward, to reward.
And your pronunciation�s OK
When you correctly say croquet,
Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,
Friend and fiend, alive and live.
Poem designed to be showcasing the difficulty of English pronounciation:

The art of "Get jumped bitch"
Guys i bought Dragon Age Veilguard, made a cute bitchboi and holy hell i was giggling at the first cutscene (epic bar-fight)
I haven't even started the game and i already love it xD
I'm glad you're enjoying it but I still despise the existance of Veilguard XD
Why? XD
Cuz it's not a dragon age game T-T
I adored origins with my Goth Witch GF
Ah but heck this game looks so amazing
Lucky for you, you can enjoy it without cringing XD
But I'm not touching that game sorry
it goes against almost everything I loved about the original games
Inquisition and origins were part of my fantasy craze long ago
Ah I need to replay origins
god damn
Have fun. Majd mes�lj milyen \:D
Valamelyikn�l nem ugy bolt, hogy rom�ncolhatt�l �gy is npc-ket, hogy nem kellett suck-up-olnod hozz�juk? Meg lehettetek bar�tok, vagy riv�lisok is �s m�g �gy is rom�ncolhat�ak voltak

Origins was like that
Nem is tudom van-e m�sik olyan rpg ahol nem kellett egy yes man-nek lenned ahhoz, hogy norm�lisan rom�ncolhass
Specifikus sztori elemek kellettek a karakterekhez �s ha nem volt a b�ka segge allat a kapcsolatod vel�k akkor volt es�lyed
Morrigannek el�g vad �tletei voltak n�ha...

- As I solidified dicegoblin I wouldn't say no to dice either
- Anything roman, viking or greek themed
- Notebooks rock (but I always just put them away not daring to use them xd)
- Art and anything hand made is always the best gift in my mind
- Workout related things are always good as well (tho they tend to be expenso)
- Spicy things
- Tea and everything tea related.
- Sadly I'm not a big fan of sweets.
Oh and

Damn I wanted to tho xD
do we want to have it the same as if we were  drawing from a hat, or should it be a single chain
so no two ppl just gifting each other?
hmmmm
I don't mind either, but if i had to make suggestions, I'd say let's not let two people pull each other
Yea

# DO YOU HAVE A FAST NOW?!?!
(aka are you in a hurry)
xDDDDD
I thought you dont eat
o.o?
I'd like to but it costs money
(jk)
I....
uhm
have no idea what would be a good gift for me, so good luck whoever draws me :)
navigator would be cool rp vise, just sayin'
�n megmondtam
Ha olyat h�zok aki nem tudja az csokit kap �s k�sz xD
*ha szereti ha nem*
I mean... we both have the same superpower of being able to give a thing for anyone no matter who we get
*Art*
Tho i'm sure you have interests, hobbies, fav food and such? XD
Or you just get b�gre with your character on it xD
And a big pack of salty chips
Brother I have barely enough energy to draw for myself xddd
Can I be still in? Im just not sure how much money I will have by the time we gift
*games* but that is way over the budget XD
perfect
I feel that xD but i'm sure you could make something :3
Surprise? *pulls out didlo*
*good enough*
60eur games? xD
I have actually be thinking about that xd
there are some in the 5-10 euro range too
but that is too much too
tbhj
I think
or like depends
but ye
Chrism discoumt
So... for Endre, games and b�gre it is xD
yea you guys can hunt for me on the winter sale XD
Regs, tell us your stuff
(and I have some stuff on my wishlist on steam)
Dont you know me well enough? Hmpf >>
We do, but current interestest and wishes can change
Never
I don't know whaf message to pin with Endre's case xD
I know what i could give you, but that'd be art, and not everyone is an artists here xD
Just speak, son
Gifting ideas for me:
- Cheap games (maybe from winter steam sale, you can spy on my wishlist)
- Art stuff especially on stuff that I can daily use like a cup
- Chips (salty) / chocolate (tofefe, or just some basic choco, or strawberry one)

Nice

This is how things should be i guess
We shall see how much of his promises keeps
Eventhough he made a lot of nonsensical promises

�I said, �Well, I�m going to do it, whether the women like it or not,�� Trump said. �I�m going to protect them.�

Every inch of Sam was nailed in this art, so cool!
Very nice :D
:D
I mean I can tell you how it works

I put the names one after each other

Dani, Bence, Nika, �gi, Anna, Reg�, Endre, M�rk

and then told it to shuffle all of them into a random order

Dani, Bence, �gi, Anna, Reg�, Endre, M�rk, Nika

and afterwards it simply went one by one, in this case Dani to Bence, Bence to �gi, �gi to Anna, etc...
and ofc at the end it went back to the end
Hek ye
<a:hellmage_emilyyeh:833496986657357824>
Lathander, sorry
Sarenrae
this way it is guaranteed a single chain
Im�dom am�gy hogy a DiceGod-os priv�t chatemben a 47db Veilguard-karakater screenshotom ut�n ott van hogy "You're gifting to xy" xD

Not addiction btw
At least now I know that I'm not the only using dicegod private chat as a misc. depository
Yes xD
yall are lucky I'm way too fucking lazy to make the new dicegod
D� birfd�j boj
that one would/will be sending you a random image every time you send it one XD

XD nem tudta, hogy ma milyen nal van
*nap
Most �r
Yea i can see
Tho ez nem ments�g xd
Hey hey! Igen sajnos ma dolgozok. Eln�z�st hogy nem sz�ltam, de nagyon el vagyok cs�szva a napokkal
�rtem �n, de ez �gy akkor sem fair, �s f�leg nem proper reason
Nem hiszem hogy olyan nagy k�r�s hogy legal�bb egy nappal azel�tt sz�ljatok ha nem tudtok j�nni
Lehet bal l�bbal keltem ma, de m�r nem tudom hogyan �lljak hozz� az eg�szhez, kezd egy kicsit sok �s elegem lenni az ilyen last-minute-lemond�sokb�l
Sr�cok, szedj�tek �ssze magatokat k�rlek, ha meg nem megy, �s �gy nektek is k�nnyebb az id�beoszt�sotokkal meg a szabadid�t�kkel, akkor l�pjetek ki, mert ez �gy nem fog menni
M�rk eddig t�bbet hi�nyozt�l mint jelen volt�l
Igen, de k�rlek vedd figyelembe az � eset�ben, hogy nagyon sokat dolgozik �s nem rajta �ll a beoszt�s, plusz m�g suliznia is kell.
(Majd mindj reag�lok erre csak �r�n vagyok(
Ok�, de akkor l�pjen ki ha nem tud jelen lenni
Mert ez �gy nem j�
Alright I'll help Nika a bit, cuz I know it's hard for her to express it properly. Before you get mad or escelate into an argument, I'm not shitting on you, I'm just saying all this for you to see why this isn't okay. I know it's a hard situation right now, nobody has to have hard feelings because of this.
 So as soon as you signed up to participate as a player in a campaign, it is your obligation to make sure you have the time and ability to commit to the sessions. Life happens and occasionally players will be missing on short notice, but this is a long lasting issue here. You guys are responsible for your own time, but not paying attention to dates, forgetting the campaign or session, planning over it or not addressing scheduling problems is something you guys are responsible for. You have options like using a calendar, setting reminders and similar but not doing anything about it is disrespectful towards the work the DM puts into each session and the other players' time.
Quitting a campaign is not something anybody will get mad at, but continuing to disrespect all the work and time people are putting in is.
Yes, thank you for your help and time to explain this
And also, side note, being physically there but not in mindset is also basically being absent, just to keep in mind
Because being on voice but not actually being there and/or being muted is not equal attending the session

I know it's a hard time and there is a lot of things going on
Just please take responsibility
Noone got mad xddd
> Before you get mad or escalate [...]
Ja, csak az �rtes�t�st l�ttam xd
(honestly I partially wrote that cuz of Endi. Sorry man, but you tend to go further than needed xd)
(I was thinking on mentioning that this week a lot of people seem to just forget which day it is)
(Nika is usually fiery enough to handle shit like this)
(fair. I also forgot what day it was yesterday xD)
(and I have like 3 other friends who forgot what day of the week it is this week)
Yeah. Okay, so. Most hogy tudom hogy M�rk nem lesz ma, most m�r csak arra vagyok kiv�ncsi, hogy Reg� ezut�n is r�sz tud/akar-e venni a session�n, rendesen jelen lenni �s akt�van r�szt venni sz�nd�kos distraction�k n�lk�l?
Mert ha nem, �s nem �rzik �gy az emberek hogy akt�van r�sz tudnak/akarnak venni, akkor nincs �rtelme megtartani ma a sessiont
Mondtam, hogy leszek

Ez azon m�lik igaz�b�l, hogy ki milyen komolys�ggal �ll hozz� mag�hoz a dndhez.
Vagy a j�t�khoz
I hate this.... but also I frequently do this...xD
Yeah csak eml�kezni kell arra is, hogy ez egy group project
Ha nem tudsz hozz��llni �gy, hogy "felelek m�sok�rt mert �k is felelnek �rtem" akkor lehet a megadott kamp�ny vagy event nem neked val�
You know, respect and all that


The walking stick
Akkor ma megy�nk tov�bb ye?
Yas
Ye, addigra tal�n a ball�bas nyomott kedvem is elsz�ll
El�re is eln�z�st ha nem lesz minden perfect
It's alright dw
No it's not

csak tudod, f�leg mostm�r, hogy mindenkinek van saj�t �lete �s nem vagyunk folyton helyhez k�tve (gimi, sz�l�k m�r akinek) �gy te is tudod, hogy a dnd m�r sokkal jobban h�tt�rbe szorult mint ann� �s ez m�g mindig, ha nem most m�g ink�bb egy szabadid�s elfoglalts�g.
�s ez�rt senkit sem �rdemes feles�ss�gre vonni, mert akkor megint egy abyss eset lesz bel�le imo....
arr�l meg, hogy kinek milyen a session�n val� teljes�tm�nye �n �gy hiszem, hogy minden mell�kes h�tr�ltat� ok ellen�re, mindent megteszek, amit tudok (lesz�m�tva mikor nem igaz�n �reztem j�l magam) hogy a r�sze legyek
Ez nem arr�l sz�l, hogy mennyire van el�t�rben vagy h�tt�rben. Ha tiszteletlen vagy valakinek az idej�vel �s befektet�s�vel akkor tiszteletlen vagy. Pont.
Nincs senki sz�monk�rve
Szabadid�s program, de ha valakinek nincs r� szabadideje, kisz�m�thatatlan, hogy mikor van el�g szabadideje, hogy a megbesz�ltek szerint r�szt tudjon venni, akkor
de ez nem szem�lyes kibasz�s, senkivel szemben
csak �gy t�rt�nnek a dolgok
Yes �s ezzel sz�molnia kell mindenkinek, annak is aki felel�s miatta
csak l�pjen ki
a dmeket sem szoktuk felel�ss�gre vonni mikor nem k�sz�lnek minden sessionre 100%-al
Mert �gy nincs �rtelme, ha egyszer van 5 havonta
Ha nem tudsz j�nni, a te dolgod jelezni id�ben, hogy nem tudsz j�nni
Nem 100%ot v�rjuk el
Vagy legyen ilyen cameo posztban
h�t az mondjuk att�l is f�gg, hogy mi miatt nem vagy
De f�leg t�led mostan�ban (pl�ne Tailsel kapcsolatban) olyan mintha a minimumot sem akarn�d beleadni
Ezzel van a gond
�gy nem sz�molunk vele alapj�raton, viszont ha m�gis r��rne esetleg a karaktere be tudna sz�llni azon a session-�n
Nem azzal hogy nem vagy perfect minden session�n
??
de ez nem az�rt van mert nem tisztelem a nika munk�j�t xd
Csak att�l m�g Nik�nak f�j
egyszer�en �gy tudok preform�lni �s szerintem ak�r mennyire sem vagyok annyira akt�v mint eddig, ugye a fent eml�tett okok miatt, �gy is pr�b�lom impactfulk�nt j�tszani a karakterem
Hogy azt l�tja, a csapat majdnem fele elfeledkezik arr�l amire igyekszik �sszeszedni az erej�t, adni nek�nk egy �lvezetes session-t
is Hikaru a joke character? yeah, kinda, de az�rt mert ahogy most m�soknak sem igaz�n van ereje norm�lisan rpzni
�n sem fogok egy full invested kidolgozott karaktert csin�lni
i want to just swing it
like the old days and like how most people play this game
ofc �s nagyon �r�l�k, hogy sz�lt, nem mondom, hogy nincs igaza
ja meg ugye hogyha 2 hetente vannak session�k, akkor persze, hogy felt�n�ek lesznek a kihagy�sok
�s nem mindenki fog tudni norm�lisan trackelni a dolgokat
f�leg m�rki eset�ben
Lehet nem az�rt van de ez az ami lej�n
�s amikor valaki �ppen valami m�s �ppen megosztja a session-t valami egy�b tev�kenys�ggel, ami ugyan�gy nem l�tfontoss�g�
aki meg szerintem az�rt is j�tszik, mert ez az egyetlen tev�kenys�g munka mellett ami kikapcsolja
Csak ugye pont az�rt lett ez mert senkinek nem volt ideje �gy mindenkinek csin�ltam
Akkor d�nts�n az illet�, hogy most melyiket akarja
a kett�t lehet�leg ne micelj�k
j�, de sajnos akkor sem tudjuk befoly�sokni, hogy meddig dolgozik, hogyan �rzi mag�t, mennyire leterhelt
�s sajnos � sem tudja
Ne legyen bel�le "Kevin elment a konyh�ba vacsor�e f�zni, meg hajat mosni, �s most r� v�runk, hogy visszaj�jj�n m�sf�l �ra ut�n"
XD
Ha kisz�m�thatatlan az id�beoszt�sod, akkor azzal k�ne sz�molni hogy nem fogsz tudni rendesen megjelenni, thus nem j�ssz
sorry, m�ltkor �pp �gy j�tt ki a dolog, hogy s�t�ttem, nem tudtam abba hagyni, de csin�ltam is, amit kellett
Meg s�ti s�t�s mixel�vel m�sok f�l�be
damn
sure if we really wanna be that strict
�ppen ez az. Ink�bb akkor csin�ld a s�tit
�s sz�lj, hogy nem leszel
De M�rk m�g k�nnyebben megoldhat� ha azt mondjuk, hogy " Valszeg nem lesz, Nika �gy sz�mol, hogy nem lesz �s ha van ideje, kedve meg ereje akkor megjelenik"
de most az�rt nem fogom kihagyni a sessiont xd
A disrespect oldala ink�bb t�led j�n Reg
Mert keresztezni a s�ti t�szta turmixol�st, zajt,
yeah, like..ez�rt mondom, hogy m�r kicsit t�l van lihegve a dndnek a fontoss�ga
�s a sz�ban t�rt�n� session-t
Nem egy j� komb�
persze azt�n meglk�tjuk mi lesz ha bej�nnek az �j kamp�nyok
de eddig, l�tj�tok, rpk sem mennek m�r �gy mint anno
like
Bocs�nat, de kollekt�ven �gy egyezt�nk meg, hogy cs�t 18 �ra session. Ha nem tartod fontosnak nem k�telez� r�szt venni �s senki nem fog �rte haragudni ha �gy d�ntesz
�n �r�ln�k, ha vissza tudn�nk r�z�dni �gy mint r�g (lesz�m�tva a written rpket mert azok t�nyleg rohadt sok id�t elvesznek)
Nincsen, csak az emberek akkor ha nem annyira fontos nekik, mondj�k azt, hogy ink�bb csin�lok m�st, nem leszek
Ne ilyen half and half, sz�tosztott figyelmes valami legyen
De ez m�g mindig nem err�l sz�l
Ellent�tben Kevinnel, �n nem v�rom el az extr�m RPt, csak azt hogy megjelensz, akkor j�tssz is, �s ha nem tudsz j�nni, sz�lj id�ben
Sajnos egy fun hobbit is komolyan kell venni ahhoz hogy j�l m�k�dj�n
nem is az, hogy nem fontos. szerintem mindenkinek fontos, ez�rt van a szerver �s ez�rt vagyunk itt egy�tt
Exactly
M�sok sz�m�tanak a t�bbiek jelenl�t�re
Mert ha nincs csapat, nincs j�t�k
Nem lehet egy jajj majd uccs� pillanatban kider�l hogy leszek-e vagy nem, mert m�sok sz�m�tanak r az emberre, k�sz�lnek, terveznek az alkalom k�r�
ofc �s az�rt ezt pr�b�ljuk elker�lni
Ha annyira bizonytalan akkor t�nyleg nem �rdemes kezdeni mert m�sok idej�vel j�tszunk
Like you wanna take part in a pob level game
absolutely fair
ok� most nem kell a p�ld�l�z�s
�rtem
Ye csak kinda sokszor megesik hogy utolso pillanatban van lemond�s
But pob only a pob level game if you start acting like a pob level player
ye mert 2 hetente van game
Amikor nem k�t hetente volt game akkor is megt�rt�nt sokszor
�s �gy egy kies�s sokkal �szrevehet�bb �s t�bb id�t kell v�rni
Ye �s tudni k�ne ak�r� tervezni ha m�r el lett v�llalva
idk cant remember
Ha nem megy nem v�llalja el az ember
sry
Dicey and the reactions xd
Mint amikor eleinte egyetemen voltam, �s otthagytam a ToA-t egy ideig
ofc ez�rt mondom, hogy k�v�ncsi leszek ha bej�n chains
meg raiders
vagy cos
b�r cos is sokkal light hearted-abb
m�rmint
depends on the dm i think
how they run it
Idk about that xDD
XD *The feel-good campaign if the century*
idk lehet csak �n l�tom m�rkit t�ls�gosan *fun guy*-nak
Szerintem nagyon sok extra kell ahhoz, hogy azt a kamp�nyt valaki kellemesebb� tegye
Mert ott mindenki miserable
rp-re gondolok ink�bb
meg contentre
�
I mean we *could* kill Strahd with sunshine and rainbows :3
Az m�g lehet
i mean
light cleric who?
Light cleric cast Color Spray xD
�s ez esik nekem rosszul
M�r a k�vi kamp�nyt v�rod mikor itt a Tails
<:bastian1:1238063088704684044>
Ha �gy dm-kedn�k mint ahogy te j�rsz sessionre akkor a playerek nagyon gyorsan ott hagyn�k b�rmelyik j�t�komat
M�s campaign-t v�rni nem b�n de ha a feeling hogy a kamp�nyod csak egy "j� ez am�g nincs m�s" valakinek az elhiszem hogy f�j
tudom �s nagyon sajn�lom, szeretem tailst, de sokkal laz�bb �tem� �s t�m�j� mint m�s kamp�nyok voltak eddig. �lvezem a storyt de nem �rzem azt sem, hogy session�n k�v�l tudn�k r� dolgozni. vannak �tleteim �s terveim, de nem tudom r�venni magam, hogy le�ljek le�rni. de m�s kamp�nnyal is �gy �rzem (kiv�ve chains bc austin simp)
bruh
Bruh, maybe but ye probably xd
okay but like
k?
i dont dm?
idk what to say xd
That's not the point
A lil bit weird analogy
no, �rtem mit mond az endre
�s valid, de
Ye same
wha?
�s nem is v�laszol arra, amit �rtam.
sry
ok�
so
I mean arra de
Amit taggelt
�n �ppen az�rt szeretem a Tails-t nagyon, mert egy all around chill-ebb pacing-�, vibe-� kamp�ny
J�lesik ennyi komoly dolog mellett
�n szeretem a tailst, de igen, sajnos nem kezelem �gy mint anno egy abysst vagy odyssyt anno �s ennek t�bb oka is van. egy r�szt mert nem �rzem �gy, hogy tudok m�r annyira hyped lenni session�kre mint r�gen plusz life. m�r deep alatt sem tudtam norm�lisan rpzni �s nem is �rzem �gy, hogy tudn�k session�n k�v�l nagyon gondolkodni ilyenekt.
*ilyeneken
me too
a hype hi�ny az�rt is van mert azok a kamp�nyok az�rt el�g sokat kivettek bel�l�k

ugye hossz�ak voltak �s a befejez�sek sem lettek mindig olyanok
Ok�s, rosszul fogalmaztam
Az f�j hogy fut a Tails, �s ok� hogy egy lighthearted kamp�ny hogy ne kelljen rajta stresszelni, az�rt f�j amikor minden m�sra v�gyik a j�t�kos kiv�ve az eny�mre, �s m�s kamp�nyokat emleget �s azt mondogatja hogy "de szeretne m�r j�tszani", amikor m�r ott van �s j�tszik a kamp�nyomban
Nem is lenne baj ha lenne favourite-ja 3 j�t�k k�z�l amiben j�tszik �s nem az eny�m az. De csak az eny�mben j�tszik tudom�som szerint
i get that. kevinnek is ez volt a baja pobbal. most nem hasonl�tgatni akarlak hozz� csak azt mondom, hogy ez egy gm dolog i suppose
De a hype hi�nya m�g nem k�ne, hogy meg�lj�n mindent
�n sem vagyok a hype fajta, de kitartok a kamp�nyok mellett amiket �lvezek
The gm sacrifices about 8 hours of time a week to make something fun for people to play. You (should) reciprocate by not making their lives harder and actually engaging with what they put blood, sweat, and tears making.
Nobody forces you to play, if you do choose to play, then give it the proper respect by actually playing it

(and yes sorry I'm still at the reading back part)
de sajnos a n�lk�l �n nem fogok annyit agyalni a karimon pl session�n k�v�l
Nem is kell session-�n k�v�l
Csak rajta
K�zben
i understand that but its not always that sersious
The time still went into it
Effort
yes
yes
So ye
Mint mondtam engem nem zavarna ha 3 j�t�kban j�tszan�l �s az eny�mre ford�tan�d a legkevesebb id�t. Itt az van az eny�mben j�tszol egyed�l �s nem kezeled �gy mintha lenne neked
Even if the game isn't serious, respect the effort
az�rt mert nem fogott m�g meg annyira. lehet a sok j�t�kid� hi�ny miatt vagy mert t�l sok komoly kamp�nyban voltam, ahol sokkal tapasztaltabb dm-ek voltak
i wanna play yes
and i try my best
eventhough sometimes thigns happen the way they do
oda fogok figyelni erre jobban
my apologies
legut�bb is az�rt pr�b�ltam sokat rpzni mert tudtam, hogy rosszul j�ttek ki a dolgok
(csak azt�n ugye t�rt�nt egy kis csal�di dolog)
�s tudod, hogy vannak �tleteim hikaruhoz, de mivel ennyi kihagy�s volt vagy te sem tudt�l �gy k�sz�lni, hogy inspir�ljon, mert mondjuk �ppen csak egy laz�bb session volt (amivel nincs semmi baj ,csak akkor nem tudok sajnos el�gg� inspired lenni) �gy nem ker�l �gy focusba a kaland
de szeretn�m ha sz�m�tanaa
mert j� karakterek vannak
meg persze magam sem tudtam az elej�n, hogy mit akarok a karakterrel pontosan
so i couldnt really invest myself in a creative process
which again had many factors
�n, ha most a magam nev�ben besz�lek, az tudom mondani, hogy: j�tszok �s pr�b�lok dolgozni azon, hogy up to date legyek a session�kkel annak ellen�re, hogy most a dnd �gy nem a "legfontosabb" tev�kenys�g sz�momra
de nem akarom t�pni a sz�m mert ha meg k�zbe j�n valami akkor meg lehet r�m mutogatni :DD
so
thats all
Broski
https://tenor.com/view/rupaul-rupaulsdragrace-rupauls-judge-judgejudy-gif-5920318
That... hurt
nem annak sz�ntam
de te is mondtad, hogy nem tudsz mind�gy �gy k�sz�lni, �s ezzel semmi baj
senki sem fogja ellened a dolgot
megbesz�lt�k
*�
Csak mi�rt a DM-en m�lik az inspir�ci� megszerz�se?
idk maybe its just me who sees it this way
mert �k csin�lj�k a t�rt�netet �s �k tal�lj�k
Kitart�s kell, vagy kisz�ll�s
But if u dont vibe with that
A t�bbi az szem�lyesen is megoldhat�
Then that's personal preference
And not on the dm
(??)
ye but i never said im not vibing
i mean like
But it feels like it a lot of times
in a sense
like
no akkor vissza
mindegy
nem tudom xd
�n tudom mit akarok mondani csak nem tudom le�rni norm�lisan
If it doesn't inspire you, doesn't move you to action, then you are just not vibing with it xD
Figyu, csak annyi k�ne, hogy pr�b�lj nem m�s dolgokat csin�lni mik�zben megy a session, �s viszonylag id�ben megjelenni
yes but
Or don't vibe with *this* part maybe
i dont want to not vibe
Don't gotta vibe the same with all of the campaign
Most ink�bb ilyen s�ti s�t�s kateg�ri�ra gondolok, mintsem csal�di dolgokra, mert persze
yes, ezt akartam mondnai
Az �rthet�, ha egyszer-k�tszer csal�di emergency van
Az�rt senki sem fog piszk�lni
But still gotta respect ot
Csak, s�ti, t�nyleg?
And give effort back
de azt megbesz�lt�k. csak �n �gy voltam vele, hogy ugyan �gy r�szt tudok venni annak ellen�re, hogy a konyh�ban vagyok
H�t, sajnos nem �gy j�tt ki
i mean...lesz�m�tva az elej�t...i think i do
de m�g az elej�n is
az�rt pr�b�ltam, ak�r mennyire is szar volt a kedvem
That's good
akkor most Hikaru nem lenne multiclassolva
vagy nem lenne semmi f�le arcja
Arc-ot tud mag�nak alak�tani az ember, ahhoz nem kell a DM-re v�eni
de tudod �n a sztorival haladok
mert sokkal �lvezetesebb meg�lni �gy a karakterfejl�d�st imo
Akkor te a k�ls� karakterfejl�d�st szereted, ami nem baj, csak
Van bels� is, amit a karakter gener�l mag�nak
Rendben
<@&1212486392240676954> 
Ma nem tartok sessiont. Mindenkinek adok 1 hetet, j�v� h�t szerda 20:00-ig mindenki d�ntse el hogyan akar hozz��llni a Tailshez
Ha �gy gondolod hogy ezeket be tudod/fogod/akarod tartani:
- J�tszol a Tailsben ami minden m�sodik h�ten cs�t�rt�k�n 18:00-21:00-ig tart, ezzel sz�molt�l �s id�t tudsz r� ford�tani (hirtelen komoly esem�nyek miatti hi�nyz�s nem sz�moland� bele)
- Ha megjelensz a session�n akkor r�szt veszel rajta akt�van, mind RPben, mind combatban
- Ha nem tudsz j�nni, sz�lsz id�ben
Akkor nagyon sz�vesen v�rlak j�v� h�ten Nov. 14-�n
Ha a fenti pontokat nem tudod/fogod/akarod tartani, akkor k�rlek d�nts hogy v�ltoztatni akarsz-e ez ellen, vagy ha nem, akkor l�pj ki a j�t�kb�l

Bocs�nat hogy id�ig jutottam de nekem itt volt el�g
Nagyon szeretek mindenkit �s mindenki karakter�t, de az�rt van egy pont ahol m�r musz�j mindenkinek meghoznia egy d�nt�st

Azzal is el�r�bb lehet tolni, k�ls� t�nyez�k n�lk�l is
yes, de akkor meg az lesz a baj mint abyssban, hogy lelkileg kik�sz�l�k xd
tho lehet m�r jobban kezelem
nincs kriszta meg kevin emotional torment
and blackmail
Nem kell a bels� karakterfejl�d�snek negat�v dolgokb�l erednie
Ardennek is pozit�v
angsty i guess xd
Persze, rakok bele angst-et, de amiket akar, az
azok pozit�v ir�nyba h�zz�k
And it feels nice
Seeing some depressed, angry character become happy and more mellow
therius?
oh wait
that was the other way around
oh...Diocles
Because I set him goals without having the DM shove me plot points
i do that too
Persze, az�rt j�lesik ha �gy �rzed a DM is szeretne valamit hozz�tenni a karakteredhez, de nem kell v�rni, hogy megv�ltson
Mint ahogy Kevin v�rta Endit�l PoB-ban
thats my toxic trait, sadly
am sry
�s nem is konzult�lt vele norm�lisan
yeee
az g�z
j�, de ott az is k�zre j�tszott, hogy kevin nem kedvelte endr�t �s makacs is volt hozz�
Pedig �v� lett volna kb. A Main Line story
well..pettyness
Sokkal t�bb, mint amit kb. b�rmelyik m�s kapott alapj�raton
-r 2d4+5d6
M�gis mi maradtunk a kamp�nyban
Mert annak ellen�re, hogy �gymond nem kaptunk semmi h�ha kamp�ny backstory connection-t, ki akartunk hozni valamit a karakterekb�l
bc yall were hyperfixared xd
still are in a sense
I wasn't
eventho omg
M�R CSAK 3 SESSION
�n mindig minden kamp�nyra ford�tok el�g figyelmet
De nem fang�rcs�l�k
Tartom a stabil jelenl�tet �s interakci�t
Nem hype-olok jobban PoB-ra, minr Tails-re
That's Nika with Scorpio
And I like that
and �gi with Ori
Nem igaz�n
Tartja a szintet
*shrug* nem voltam el�g session�n
OR
De nem megy �t s�pol�s j�t�kba, mint kamp�ny elej�n
its the grei simp :DDD
Az�ta stagn�lt a helyzet
Most ilyen general hozz��ll�s, which is nice
i know i see that
Nika meg eg�sz kamp�nyban tartotta a hyperfixation-t, ami szint�gy nice
she is the opposite of I can fix him
Csak az g�z, amikor az elej�n giga hyperfixation van, azt�n p� h�nap ut�n teljesen lehal az eg�sz
If anything, PoB makes me more frustrated XD
Because the spells: Maze and that bullshit that happened last night XD
Egyszer nem tudtam meg�tni Lacaine-t
Be lettem stun-olva, am�g meg nem �lt�k a t�bbiek
De az a magas szint� D&D hib�ja, nem Endi�
De nagyon elbaszta a kedvem tegnap az a spell
ofc
I mean I still love Ori xD
And everyone else in the campaign
Just somehow the rp fell off
Mert mindig, minden final boss fight-ban a karakterem valahogy el van lehetetlen�tve ilyen bullshit-ek miatt XD
xd
I like nice and steady
Or hyper, but hyper all the time
A different stability
are you describing sex?
pussy must be sore
OOP
https://tenor.com/view/oop-queen-and-i-oop-what-you-say-queen-oop-gif-25627470
If RPGs can be considered sex, then my sex life is A-OK
Idk I kinda wish we had more rp-s with the polycule
whats that?
�n sz�vesen rp-zek m�g mindig
�r�sban is
The trio
A poly couple
Endit m�g piszk�lom a kis self-set side mission dolgaimmal
�n pr�b�lok kital�lni rp szitukat, de soha nem jutok vele semmire mert vagy elkezdem is elmegy a kedvem vagy csak szimpl�n elfelejtem
Ye on session its awkward xd
ami megint csak ebben az esetben sem, nika hib�ja
For me
Same
Csak �r�sban meg nem �r�nk r� xD
yes
Figyu, max meghagyjuk az rp csatorn�kat akt�v-ra kamp�ny ut�n
Meg kicsit t�l komoly detailbe tud nekem menni n�ha
you have your own little polycule now...you...bence...and that snake in your backpack
�s rp-zhet�nk amikor r��r�nk, van r� el�g id�, energia

Kedv
M�rmint �gy �rted, hogy te toln�d t�l komoly r�szletezve, vagy a m�sik f�l, �s ez k�nyelmetlen neked?
Idk
Maybe both
M�s nev�ben nem tudok nyilatkozni hogy �n milyen voltam xd
lol, Alton and Hosak
H�t, PoB rp-ben el�g tame
Csak volt amikor olyanokat rpzt�nk le ami valahogy sz�momra feleslegesnek t�nt
De I guess nekem kellett volna sz�lni hogy az �t szeretn�m l�pni
absolutely mind blowing OwO?
XD
BUSSIN
J�l van Reg� pihenj egyet vagy valami xdd
�n m�g sz�vesen le-rp-ztam volna egy csom� dolgot ami m�ra m�r feled�sbe mer�lt
de senkit sem �rdekelt
https://tenor.com/view/shocked-lana-condor-seventeen-shookt-surprised-gif-17273077
I could've used some pick me ups somedays
Just some nice little rp
�rdekelt volna csak k�zben meg m�sok kimaradnak/nem vesznek r�szt
�gy nem olyan j�
sorry, i kinda los touch with Sindor since I could really do aynthing with him
Persze van akinek van �lete �s ilyen mennyis�gre nincs id�/kedv mindig xddd
De ez�rt van �r�sban
�gy az ember akkor tud �rni amikor r��r
Ha 10 �v m�lva, akkor ak�r 10 �v m�lva
XD
De akkor a k�vi nem menne ha lenn xD
Ja
Meg mindenki csak v�r
Idk
Not gud
Gud in theory, kinda sad in practice xd
Written rp pros and cons
Also the thing is you can't expect people to play outside of the game time
Az �l�ben l�v� rp-nek csak annyi el�nye van, hogy egyb�l reag�lnak az emberek (ami lehet el�g meh egy �rott verzi�hoz k�pest aminek van ideje, hogy norm�lisan megfogalmazz�k), �s az instant, �l�ben szerzett �lm�ny
Cause some don't want all their free time to be thinking about dnd xd
Aside from these two, I prefer written
Yeah
De ez�rt is j� az �r�sos, mert lehet akkor �rni amikor valakinek kedve is van
Exactly
�s nem az van, hogy a kamp�ny 10 �ve volt, sz�ban
(�s honestly a mai probl�m�ban is ez a l�nyeg)
just saying
Senki sem eml�kszik semmire, csak arra, hogy all around j� volt
Hanem vissza lehet dolgokat olvasni
Not really
but we done with that
�s jobban meg lesz �rizve �r�sban
akkor legal�bb is, amit �n mondtam
It was about the discussed game time
Azt betartani �s tisztelni ahogy legjobban lehet ha m�r elv�llalta valaki hogy r�sztvesz
And paying attention and participation without needless outside distractions
Then there was some misunderstanding bc outside of game wasn't the issue xdd
But yes
Supposedly we are
Not at all
�n sem folyamatosan dnd-n agyalok
Kismilli� dolog van ami fontosabb
De van bennem annyi, hogy mikor le�l�k j�tszani megtisztelem a GM munk�j�t �s a j�t�kost�rsaim idej�t a figyelmemmel
alright
Azt is mondtad, hogy rem�led az ody, raiders, cos vagy chains majd visszahozza a kedved ahhoz, hogy norm�lisan j�tsz
I just want to mention that with this artitude towards the game, the group and our gatherings as a whole, don't consider yourself autamically invited to either of my future games
Fix your attitude and we'll talk about it if we see an improvement
<@463641084971712514>
<:oricry:1266108627366711368> <:oricry:1266108627366711368> <:oricry:1266108627366711368>
I didn't want to escelate, but if you want to be a disrespectful asshole, be one. I don't mind.
Az el�z� session-�n eml�keim szerint rendesen jelen volt m�r
Sz�val rem�lhet�leg �gy fog menni a k�s�bbiekben

XD
(same applies tbh)
Idk lehet kicsit harsh
�rtem honnan j�n ez
Mert v�rni a j�t�kot ami megjav�t
Nem igaz�n lehet �gy j�l j�tszani
Simply from what I saw in Tails so far and during that little time in Alken, as a gm I wouldn't choose that to happen at my table
De igaz lehet egy kis gondolkod�s nem �rtana hogy t�nyleg �gy akarod-e ezt kezelni
No the problem is that he "thinks" it "might" improve with one of those games
M�rmint a game that will fix me mentality
I get it yes
I'm not risking another campaign on a shaky player again. I made that mistake with Kevin last time.
Still maybe the wording wouldve been better
And perhaps in private
Cuz I get it for him it's not a big deal but he needs to understand that not being there isn't just a net zero. It always turns into a net minus, cuz it ruins the fun of other players, the dm and pushes the session vibe away.
To not be a public humiliation
Its only gonna bring anger
And not actual thinking
He publicly humiliated Nika
Most likely
Hm
By saying her campaign is not worth much
Fair enough
And after that basically saying "sorry not sorry" when Nika expressed dissapointment
That was disrespectful
But maybe don't sink to that level still xd
Idk it's a difficult issue
Cause respect for respect
And he gave very little xd
I think we gave a whole lot of respect on a lot of occasions
That is true
Ez a hobbi fontos a legt�bb embernek, pl�ne azoknak akik �r�kat fektetnek a session eltervez�s�be, �s azt f�lv�llr�l venni nem sz�p
Especially ha beismered, hogy ez most nem�rdekel de a k�vetkez�k majd tal�n fognak.
�s azt is hozz� kell tegyem, hogy ez nem csak egy dnd probl�ma m�r
M�r egy ideje nem az
�nmag�ban az sem gond, ha m�r nem izgat anynira, csak akkor ha van valami amit irl csin�lnod kell, vagy akarsz, akkor ne keresztezd a kett�t. Ink�bb mondd le a session r�szv�telt akkor
Ezen m�r asszem t�l vagyunk xd
This is true tho
Yeah a session lemond�s megoldhat�. Ez�rt nem zabos senki M�rkra. El�fordul, hogy hib�zunk, elfelejtette ez van. Legk�zelebb sz�lunk, hogy rakjon figyelmeztet�st vagy be�rja a napt�r�ba
Ja
Megesik. Velem is megesett m�r. �n m�r felejtettem el saj�t session�m is
:)))
Pedig azt hittem mindent norm�lisan elmagyar�ztan
Kinda. De neh�z j� �rveket adni ha a dolog csak arra j�n ki, hogy: "ne agg�djatok, csak ezek a dolgok miatt vagyok seggfej."
Nem vagyok seggfej. �szint�n elmondtam mindent, semmi k�ppen sem megb�ntani akartam b�rkit
Elmondtam mi volt a gond anno, elmlndtam mi a gond most.
Senkit sem al�ztam meg
Nem volt sz�nd�komban xd
Elhiszem, hogy nem �gy sz�btad
�s egy�ltal�n nem v�rom el hogy a j�t�k jav�tson meg...bruh �pp ellenkez�leg. �n a csak a j�t�khoz val� inspir�ci�r�l �s motov�ci�r�l besz�ltem
�s rem�lhet�leg rendez�dnek a dolgok
De mondtam is
J�t�kon k�v�li gondok effekt�lnak
Mindenki id�ben ott lesz kezd�skor (vagy lehet�leg ak�rny�k�n), �s figyel, �s akt�vkodik
Same with organizing stuff when we have an irl outing
De ezt is mondtam. Meg ha az el�n nehezen is �lltam hozz� alapb�l mag�hoz a ttrpghez
Mindig megpr�b�ltam az�rt amit tudtam
�n nem �gy �reztem sajnos
Nekem az a vibe-om volt, hogy nincs kedved jelen lenni, sz�vesebben figyeln�l m�sra
Csin�ln�l m�st
�s ez nem csak t�ged effekt�l hanem mindenkit aki jelen van
Drakkenn�l, Alkenn�l, Tailsn�l
�s ez f�j j�t�kosoknak �s a dmnek
Drakkenn�l???
�n voltam az egyik leginvestedebb j�t�kos
Ody fel�ben, raiders alatt, abyss v�g�n.
Mert nem �lted Bucco-t ez�rt folyton a v�g�t akartad, hogy csak legyen m�r v�ge
Szenvedt�l
Vagyis ink�bb ami Bucco �tja volt
mert kb. lehetetlen g�l volt
J�l van
Akkor
Nem akarok belesz�lni, de szerintem ez m�r el�gg� t�l van t�rgyalva. A levonhat� tanuls�got m�r mindenki levonta akinek kellett.
K�sz�n�m m�g egyszer, hogy figyelembe van v�ne az, hogy �n is teszek er�fesz�t�seket, de mkkor m�r van egy kis attitude vagy gond a r�szemr�l
�m vagyok a vil�gi szar
�n most mindent elmondtam amit tudtam a legnyugodtabban
Nope
�s leg�rthet�bben
�n befejeztem, aki nem tudja feldolgozni, ez van
Definitely top3, I can support this claim
De ha most valakik nagyon orrolnak r�m
Nem igaz�n, ink�bb csak szar helyzet
Legyem bazdmeg. Megszoktam hogy mindig egy id� ut�n ki vagyok pczve. Im mot holding anything against anyone
Im just grtting frustrared
Idk �n nem akarlak pczni
Pr�b�lok legkev�sb� szem�lyes lenni
As well
Szerintem Dani durva volt most pl
�s igen pr�b�lkozol
Ami n�ha neh�z
De lehet a gondok helyett csak bocs�natot k�ne k�rni Nik�t�l
Csak az�rt mert most sajn�lja a nik�z
Yes
Fair
�n csak azt akarom, hogy legyen a current kamp�ny, id�ben session, norm�lis r�szv�tel, nem nyavajg�s hogy mikor lesz v�ge a jelenlegi kamp�nynak
�rtem
Rohadtul szar nekem
Is
Mert szar neki igen
Durva voltam igen. Amit elismerek nem kellett volna de Nik�t s�rtette, nem is kicsit.
U disrespected her campaign
You didn't mean it
And instead of an apology I started stating the causes
De tudod csak az�rt nem �rtem baszod, hogy mi�rt viselkedik mindig annyira non confrontationalk�nt amikor mrg azt�n olyeneket csin�l.
Te vagy au dani aki mindig golyton
�sszer�en
Akarja megbesu�lni a dolgokat
�s most meg �tvetted a nika frusztr�ci�j�t
???
�sszer�en akarom �tbesz�lni a dolgokat igen
Nem �tvettem
Egy�tt�rzek vele dude xd
Nem szeretem ha az �rzelmeim vez�relnek ilyenkor
Mert szar l�tni, hogy ilyen alap dolgokon bukik meg az eg�sz, mint jelen lenni id�ben �s jelen lenni szellemileg
Mert szar ha l�tsz�lag leszarj�k a munk�d
Ami te is tudod milyen
Mert elvileg folyton azt �reztetj�k veled pedig nem az a c�l
De ez m�r egy r�gi probl�ma amit r�g�ta n�z�nk el mert tudjuk, hogy neh�z �s nem �rezz�k, hogy javul. Legal�bb is �n nem �rzem, �s ma a Tails fel� men� kommentjeidre kifakadtam
Sok
Sok, hogy mindig azt hiszed ki vagy pczve
Danir�l besz�lel
Ye ha gond van akkor meg lesz besz�lve veled
De az nem pcz�s
Nem ellened vagyunk, hanem egy probl�m�t akarunk megoldani ami m�r sok ideje megy
J� csak az hogy �n vagyok a segg meg a lapilis
Like...thanks
Im trying
Yes u are
De akkor, j� ennyi volt az emberek t�relmd
Ok�
Vagy akkor mosg megint l�pjek ki egy id�re?
Bc...i am?
Idk neh�z �gy b�rmit megbesz�lni xd
???
Not the point
We are escalating too much now
Idk..mim problematic it seems
Thats all
Keep trying, apologize to Nika, and thats all
Jajj ne menj�nk erre
Figyu, ha norm�lisan meg tudsz jelenni id�ben, rendszeresen, �s tudsz figyelni, ne l�pj ki, mert akkor nincs probl�ma
Elegem van mindkett�t�kb�l
A faszt kell victimkedni
Nika was disrespected
U workin on stuff
And Dani is frustrated
U keep workin
Do your best
Apologize
And all is well
XDDD
�n m�r r�g letudtam
I believe you can do better cause I've seen u better
De fel kell hozni a r�gi dolgokat
Voltak dolgok amik nem voltak sz�pek igen
�s nem improvoltak sokat
Mert seemingly nem �rted mi f�j Nik�nak
Ami ugyan�gy f�jna neked ha veled t�rt�nne meg
Change takes times, for fucks sake just stop jumping to the weirdest public punishments
R�gi dolgok csak akkor vannak felhozva ha most is probl�m�k
Yes
Nem az�rt vannak felhozva mert az a gond a l�nyeg
Hanem mert a root ugyanaz
�n m�r nem tudom tbh
Ok�, nem victim akarok lenni, de akkor l�that�, hogy ki az oka mindennek appearantly xd. Mert r�gen is folyton ha ilyen gond volt a dani a k�pembe v�gta, hogy "h�t igen, ez meg ez az eset is arra szolg�l, hogy te vagy a hib�s �s neked kell v�ltoztatni." �s bocs�nat, nem csak �n kellettem ahhoz hogy azokra a pontokra eljussak mind abyssban, mknd draklenben mind odyssyben (ami mellegleg hozz� teszem csak faszs�g volt a r�szemr�l de senkire nme volt rajtam k�v�l kihat�ssal. �n mindig minden j�t�kban v�ltoztattam egyb�l a karaktereimen, ak�r trinit miatt zorah miatt sune miatt fasz tudja ki miatt....
�s most megint itt tartunk csak most az�rt mert t�l k�nnyelm� vagyok
Szerintem nem itt a gond
Or maybe a lil
Idk how to tell u in a way you'd understand
Im a sicko XD
xdd
Or idk anymore
That's not it either
You may be trying
I genuinely dont know anymore
But somehow you do or say things that are really upsetting
And u fail to acknowledge it
Which is?
Even when people come to you with it
Like this with Nika
Being honest?
No
Listen
She said she had enough of the constant distractions and missings on a whim
Or the innaction
Cause she feels disrespected
And instead of understanding that this is a valid feeling and apologizing, and making an effort to do better (which u are doin according to u yes), you just address your life issues as a cause
But that won't solve anything
We know it's shit now
All sucks
And you are working through stuff
But that is no excuse to act like this towards anyone
Noone will fault you if you currently don't feel up to things
Cause shits hard
But it's hard differently for everyone
And she puts in time
If you need time then ask her that
That you know what, you might be right and the shit in my life is really sucky rn
�n teljes m�rt�kben �ltal�n�ss�gban besz�ltem
nem arra akartam r�vezetni, hogy nekem mennyi bajom van xdddd
And I just brought an example xd
hanem csak azt mondtam, hogy life happens
Yes it does
But wasn't only this stuff
pont ezt akarom m�r elker�lni de akkor i guess az emberek m�r erre asszoci�lnak
well
im sorry
and i said sorry and i adressed it to her
and i said i want to do better
and be there and i will be therex d
like
Ez nem asszoci�ci�.
Nekem a f� bajom, hogy ez egy konstans visszat�r� dolog
�s mindig el van n�zve mert neh�z. De tudod nek�nk is pont ugyan olyan neh�z az �let�nk
De mi nem viselked�nk �gy veled
Csak mikor kifakadunk mert el�g volt
Mint most �n amit nem kellett volna
ami ugyan �gy vissza t�r� dolog
the process is the same appearantly
Yeah.
bazdmeg ugyan ez volt lol�val is
m�g epakokor
gec
fuh
Okay but like think about it for a minute
nah
Not mad or anything
I calmed down
i dont really want to anymore
elf�radtam
Akkor hagyjuk
Think about it later
Rest on it
We all gotta
Good
�n eleget gondolkodtam m�r mindenen. eleget gondolkodtam b�l�ban kilencedikben. eleget gondolkodtam itt m�g dani�k nem voltak. eleget gondolkodtam abyss alatt
Nice
im tired of this
im sorr
*y
im not mad either its just
what else should I do ffs?
Think before you speak
no
Akkor megbesz�lt�k
We make sure that your emotions matter, but we don't feel like our emotions matter to you.
I guess that's it
That's the issue xd
sure
sure
ofc
yes
Nem kell gondolkodni, csak legy�l itt id�ben, �s j�tssz
obviously
vagy ne �s ne
igen, egy id�ben m�r nem �rdekel
Akkor ne higyj nekunk
�s tudod mi�rt? mert mondtam hogy eleget gondolkodtam azon, hogy ki mit gondol �s �rez
�n nmindig pr�b�ltam erre figyelni
The thing is that it doesn't feel like it at times

We are desperately trying to help you see
bruh
That at times you say and do incredibly disrespectful things
Even if you don't mean it
Cause we know you don't
But that's because you don't see it that way
You seemingly don't understand why things are disrespectful to others
And when we try to tell you
You think we are angry and want you to suffer
Or smth idk xd
But the it'd happen to you, you'd feel just as upset
And when you are that upset and feel rightfully hurt we back you up
I know this can be a lot and sucks when friends do it
But something is gotta start you on thinking
OotA-van voltam �n is c�lkeresztben
Szar volt
H�nytam a s�r�st�l
But you know what
Yes I was fuckin disrespectful
I might have been right in my eyes, and dm weird in his ways
But he was dm and he controls the game and I was fuckin disrespectful
And now I try not being such a bitch about game mechanics and other shit like that
Cause I was a little bitch about them
And I hurt others
And I don't wanna do that anymore *so I fuckin did something*
And I hope it can be felt
Didn't come up after that anymore
So maybe if the issue comes up this much then the direction of you thinking and trying might be due to a change
I'm sorry you feel hurt
Because you self respected and noticed the issue.
I'm sorry if we hurt you
Just like how a lot of us did when we were "targeted"
And non of it was intentional
Neither from you or for us
But somethings gotta be done because this stuff really comes up way too much and as you said, you are tired
And we are too
Rest on it, and think some later
If not then well thats the end of the story
We can't really do anything about that
That's your decision then
<:point:951578243415302235>
Somehow we always end up here with talkin it out
It would be the best if people just fuckin listened instead of feeling attacked
Kriszt�val is szerintem sim�n meglehetett volna dolgokat besz�lni
De eld�nt�tte hogy nem akar gondolkozni rajta
De akkor fasz�rt g�r�zn�nk ennyit ha nem �rdekelne a dolog xd
Ha nem akarn�nk megoldani akkor nem baszakodn�nk vele
Ki lenne dobva a perpetrator oszt cs�
Idk bennem ennyi volt xd
F�radt vagyok m�r �n is
Teljesen egyet�rtek mindennel amit �rt�l
And I don't really have anything meaningful to add so yeah

Hey <@191254206072487936>, welcome to **RPG Corner**!



V�gig vittem a Veiguardot
I cried
But it's so good omg
I need to process the feels before i start a new run
I tested two endings with this first run
xD
I started the ending before finishing all important faction quests, because i was curious how it'll effect the ending
And shiit it effected the ending, by a lot
I never seen any extra endings in any games, how can ppl replay the same game several times? o.o
So after this ending, i went back to finish those quests, and shit, the two endings are so different in outcome
By loving it so much thag one wants to experience every part of the game
for me if there is no new mechanic to learn it is done
Well just choose a different class
Boom, a new mechanic
depends on the game that is not always true
but ye it can help

No no no. He's only affraid of you because he doesn't want to catch the gay.
XDD well if he is that concerned then he might have to look inwards
Well if he's afraid of women then maybe he *should* catch the gay xD
a little bit
Lol xD
I mean Reg� is a living example of this idea in action
XDDDDDDDDDD
WHAT DO YOU MEAN??
xDDD
Afraid of women? Just be gay!
I had a girlfriend


Gunslinger would be somewhere between magus and fighter I suppose?
https://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/s/ZRwBVBSH83
Uhm, magus and barb I'd say, cus still spike damage dealer
Your reliable attacks hit yea but don't do shit without crit
Fair. I either blow their head off or hit them with a light breeze.
Inventor?
Inventor is a barbarian who needs to succeed on a skill check to rage but is int based so is good at skills stuff
Animist is caster that is quite close to a sorcerer but versatility is even higher, being able to change shit on daily prep, but is less potent and more action hungry to realise that utility mid-day
Exemplar is I don't fucking know
From what I read it almost plays like a fancy barbarian with extra tricks
So
Swashbuckler + barb xd

i could carry 2 pianos one in each hand
and not care
*looks up items*
I CAN CARRY A SETPIECE WITH ME
POGGIES
fucking easy
"that guy trapped in this fuckin haunted piano? i'm gonna give him to you for a fiver"
What is this? ||Charlotte's piano from Drakenheim?||
Because my character was a fellow bard
Originally, I wanted Csiperke to open a club or something and commemorate Charlotte by having a piano named that, but I don't know if that could've been achieved in the end
There was a lot of talk about expeditions to the Feywild, and traveling the Draken continent
I just heard fey and my mind immediately went: Doubt everything

they decided to do the thinking thing
With actual drug side effects and shit like that
Reflavoured Thaumaturge?
If it could be done with the PF wisdom equivalent stat instead of Cha
the stats are the same
str dex con int wis cha
Can the Cha main stat be changed to Wis without the class falling apart?
Or even weakened
I don't know how pf handles main stat changes

When Wolf gave the elixir to Pyre, Pyre said: Why can't you use **this**? (Or something like that) and I assumed that was addressed to Bran
Because the prior interaction was about his shitty addiction from the quicksilver
Yes that was addressed to him xD

Bran uses mutagens as well xD
Pyre wouldn't get addicted to quicksilver mutagen just bleed a little.
That is a Bran issue from him using it for a few decades in the past.

<@&1252526295951343669>
After pob ends I'll focus on finishing and running this until Popa can pick up gm-ing in the spring
1. Let me know that you are still up to play in this lvl40 short adventure focused on combat and puzzles.
2. I need to have a test combat scenario to see how the fuck I should build the monster statblocks, this I would plan on the 3rd of December, is this alright with everyone?
3. The adventure itself will probably start in the earliest parts of January
<@242727379447971840>
<@875753704685436938>
I'll let you guys know what I'll need for the test combat soon

Depends on how we wanna gm with M�rk
I can't do 3 games a week
for sure
So we either run 2 games at the same time in a biweekly manner
Or I'll have to wait till his game finished or I finish Alken
ye
Biweekly might be the best
probs
Yea my idea was that I run this while you ready up
And then u guys do whatever as I run Alken + the exchange groups sess
We also have to decide between irl or online
for a moment I was like "hmm would gpt be helpful in me trying to describe things on how I want them to look"
then a realized that an AI giving instructions to an artist is way too distopian sounding so I was like na-ah XD
XD
Somewhat spoily (spoily but doesn't spoil too much without context i think) sketch of my Rook :3
*Ofc, some things are not true to the cutscenes to satisfy the artist's fantasies*

:D
I just realized i could make The Yria in the character creator, since the original art u used for her was a DA character too xD or at least... the tattoo the artist put on the character is from the DA games, it's in the Veilguard too as an option xD
the OG yria btw XD
this is the official game art
Yeee az artra gondoltam amit a PoB Yriahoz haszn�lt�l xD
yea azt csak tal�ltam vhol xD
*Shit now i have to make her*
the og.og.og Yria (from the first game XDDDDD)
This is the OG pob? The one you finish today is the pob remastered edition?
I like her curve- wait...

*After a few moments she comes back with a curled up parchment.*
- I made some.... plans...
*And she curles out a blueprint of a teahouse.*
*His mouth slowly forms into a smile wider and wider with each passing second.*
� That's amazing! You did that all by yourself?
*Scorpio can see a beautifully decorated main lobby, a perfect kitchen, living quarters in the back, bedroom for you, a nursery, etc.*
- Yes, although discussed with some architects of course.
� Maybe you could also try being an architect, cuz this...
*He chuckles is amusement.*
� ...This is incredible!
Eeghon (sending stone): ```Niamh and Rose is completely unconcious, we don't know what to do... what's happening?```
*He takes a better look at each part of the blueprint.*

*Yria is waiting for something.*
\- Nursery?
- Well... we'll need it... quite soon...
*She says with a smile she can't hold back anymore.*
*Places her hand on her stomach.*
*Scorpio stands up instantly, standing to face Yria entirely, but remains motionless otherwise. He stares. Like he's petrified.*
� Huh?
*Shock, confusion, and a held-back smile is written across his face. Maybe he's holding the smile back in case he misheard it.*
� Are you serious?
*She just smiles for a moment, nods.*
- Uhumm... I think just the right timing as well, unless you don't want to be a dad or something...
snek
*He runs a hand through his hair, blowing out air he was holding in, grinning widely. He turns around, but freezes for a second before slowly turning back.*
� Wait a minute.
*He takes a few steps closer.*
� You came to fight while... You almost...!
*Scorpio stops himself, turns away a bit to calm down.*
� Doesn't matter now. The past is the past.
*He mumbles mostly to himself before turning back.*
� I'm so... so incredibly happy right now!
*He then hugs her tightly.*
- There is no reason to bring someone into a doomed world, I had to come.
*As she gets hugged she doesn't allow that tight of a squeeze.*
- Careful now...
*But hugs back of course.*
� I will not crush anyone, don't worry!
*He whispers with the biggest, goofiest smile ever.*
� But oh girl, don't expect me to allow you to do hard or heavy or exhausting stuff now. Also, we should tell the others, and tell your dad he's going to be a grandpa.
(so the kids is half elf and half...butterknife?)
(or half...object?)
(�n...)
(i wanna squeeze a neck, possibly yours)
(xD)
(do you wanna cast animate object on Reg�?)
(XD)
(*jk)
(*butterknife*)

Oh ye
Grei, prepare for battle
XD
We have a score to settle
Our 3rd duel that Arden promised way back when


https://x.com/PunchingCat/status/1856216863954575613?t=GmgHrjvIDxIvxAxSogmmiQ&s=19
-Oh...��s...Tudod m�r kit�l vessz�k el? Vagy esetleg van valami shaper m�dszer arra, hogy valamelyik�nk pszionikusan meginpregn�l�djon? *Ad egy cs�kot Arden fej�re �s b�ztat�an megpaskolja a h�t�t apr� �t�sekkel.*
-r 1d6
-r 1d6
*Ezeket hallva bal kez�vel er�sen �tmassz�rozza saj�t, elv�r�s�d�tt arc�t, ami a regener�ci�t biztos�t� gy�r� kitart� hord�s�nak h�la ism�t teljesen �p, test�vel �s tork�val egyetemben. Olyan, mintha sosem esett volna semmi baja. M�r nem azon a karcos, h�rg� hangon sz�lal meg, mint kor�bban, �s jobb szeme, amit meg is forgat Sindor rem�lhet�leg viccnek sz�nt felvet�seit hallva, ki is tisztult a v�rt�l.*
- **Senkit�l sem vessz�k el a gyerek�t**, �s nem is fog senki senkit anyagkezelni,... mert az impregn�l�s az azt jelenti... Legal�bbis common-ban... *J�t�kosan megragadja Sindor arc�t h�velyk-, �s mutat�ujj�val, �s kicsit megh�zza, majd elemgedi.*
- Te, csodabog�r.
*Sindor vicsorog.* -Vrau.
(*This man can't be helped XD He needs to be put down*)
Dear <@520697326679883808>, You've reached level 65!
We need to exhume Nyx
And res her
- Egy sz�l�s �gy �rzem b�rmelyik�nk sz�m�ra el�g neh�zkes lenne..
*Tekint Sindorra enyh�n felvont szem�ld�k�kkel.*
- Meg a gyermeklop�snak �n se lenn�k nagy t�mogat�ja, de vannak mellette opci�ink. Ha nagyon tradicion�lis �ton akarunk menni akkor rengeteg gyermek v�r rendes otthonra �rvah�zakban.. F�leg �gy a h�bor� ut�n...
*Halkan s�hajt ahogy a oldalra tekintve megvakarja tark�j�t majd Arden fel� fordul.*
- Amellett hallottam m�gikus t�rgyakr�l is melyek k�pesek csak v�rb�l, ak�r t�bb mint k�t ember v�r�b�l is egy ut�dot l�trehozni... Nem tudom pontosan hol lehetne tal�lni ilyesmit, de az egy opci� lenne ha v�r szerinti gyermeket szeretn�l vel�nk.
*Mosolyog a bloodhunterre.*
- Vagy persze lehet mindkett� is.
*Nevet fel halkan.*
-UUhh...Build your own child....
(yes xD)
*He seems very fascinated about the idea.*
I dunno if that'd be possible... she used her final action :(
Ah ye
Akkor asszem m�r nem lehet :c
I'd love to res her, bur yeah :'D
Well make her a statue then at the temple xD
Her and the snake god
Yiss :3 she's probably out there somewhere as Khagmarr's most precious soul
Ahhh lord i'd have loved to see how their story turns out
She's probably one of the angel types by now
Ah that's sweet
:D
Also, ez nem volt a threadek k�z�tt, de Nyx remdszeres k�rdezett Khagmarrt�l, es ez az egyik kedvenc k�rd�ssorozatom t�le xD

Literally one of the abilities of the new pf2e class xd
(Imagine a kid between the 4 of them. What would that kid even be? What soul would it harbor (if any)?)
XDD
<:oricry:1266108627366711368>
(Probably fucked up because Arden still has the Hunter's Band in him xd)
Az�rt Ulhar majd felkeresi a csal�dj�t asszem
Meg az�rt j� lenne egy rendes s�rhelyet adni neki
ki halt meg?
Nyx
M�r r�gen


(it'd definitely harbor a soul, and the item makes a healthy child for certain)
(it'd most definitely be a true lycanthrope)
(that's all we know for sure xD)
(also it's a legendary item sooo we would probably only rent it if we even find one xD)
(A half-elf, half plant, full lycanthrope, probably psyon)
(honestly if they all gave blood, with all that elf blood the kid might actually just be some kind of elf plant lycanthrope xD)
( <:vampszaj:691399147516985384>)
(Oh, ye, there's also the dhampirism)
(that's mild enough)
(Also plane touched)
(isn't Sindor an Ash elf tho? Or am I remembering wrong again? xD)
(He is but Grei is from another plane)
(Well ye but I don't think that'd be enough planar influence)
(it'd however give a slight chance for the child to be a shadar-kai xD)
(but their souls are so specially tied to the Raven Queen)
(so ye only a slight chance)
(*let's random generate a kid*)
(Also a stoner)
(xdd)
M�g ennek a csatorn�nak az elej�n is volt rp XD
(It says a "functioning child" so that's off)
(technically the dm would determine the race of the child)
(but I feel randomizing would be more fun xD)
(btw this is the item, and I know it's very much very homebrew *but I like it* xD)

(all your crazy shit cancels out and you get a perfectly normal human without any special quirks)
(xD)
(perfect xD)
(*too much elf, can't compute, human it is then*)

(so that's like one favour from Corellon... Two favours from Corellon... Three favour from Corellon... What the fuck is the Raven queen doing here? You know what fuck you. Human.)
(yes xD)
(Also hes gonna havw diabetes)
(*healthy example of its kind*)
(why diabetes tho? xdd)
(Bc they dont want him to have a mormal childhood)
(ok xd)
(who they?)
(Idk)

M�r v�rtam xd
My eyes are sweating guys
Help
Sz�val mi lesz a kisl�nyb�l?
Pyromaniac
XD
The next Azula with a bit of psion sprinkle
2 girls?
Hmmm could be
Tho i was thinking a girl and a boy
That's one mighty acrobatic baby
I'd like to see a baby try to hang onto someone like that xddd
The one om the top left, there's a carrier it's just... yeah can't see xD that's what the harness is for
Fair enough XD
On the other he just has the sheer force of ear grab xD
Babies can grip hard
Lil monkeys
They would just fall
Idk
Cant remember
I was a baby too long ago
xD
Yes

The ninja kid
Can't walk yet, but he got those anti-gravity grabber hands like a Coala
I mean... antigravity kinda works here xD
Coala? Koala? ***Cola?***
Scorpio was a psionic-graviturgy caster xD
L�tszik XD
that was my first thought too
Just imagine, Scorpio having to entertain the girl with little fire-breaths blown into the air because that's the only thing that keeps her quiet xD
*�s m�g **Yri��rt** agg�dik a t�z mellett*
When he **is** the fire XD
Ahh i have so many ideas omg
XD
That is such a blursed little gremlin
<:idek:694605001502228540>
*The dragon killing instinct starts early* XD
Defecfive but supernatural children everywhere
One from 4 fathers
And 2 from a loli and a magical, talking spatula
Why would they be defective?
I JUST STATED THE FACTS
Sindor and Grei don't even want kids XD
What facts?
And Arden wants to adopt
What if they make a cocktail and tallulah births the child?
This was far even for me
Sry bout that
What facts? I'm sorry?
Arden wants to adopt someone who already exists without a home
Not play barista with some spell XD
Come on..look at the parents
They are all werid
*weird
Damn im tired
That doesn't mean they and their kids are all defective xd
Okay Reg� please point at your normal character. I'll wait
XD
Uhm
Hello?
I just did
Sindor is anything but normal XD
Yes, they have quirks, yes one is physically somewhat disabled with a prosthetic, but they are healthy and well xd
Kisk is best boy btw
Kisk has daddy issues and is a big fuckoff lizard
Next
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? XD
XD
I don't think race should count for this unless it's inherently fucked up
He is the pinnical of innocens
*innocense
???
Idk
Leoris was as well
And now look at him
Anyone with an "I can fix them" mentality should not be considered normal XD
He is a fuck machine, i knkw
Okay so anyway xD
XD
Pls don't use such a strong word as defective when they're clearly not
My apologies
Im just really tired xd
Maybe take a long rest xD
I know they are lovely and will be sucessful in the future as....
Get some of those exha points off
Pyromaniacs and...astronauts
xD
Idk
XD
And dragon loving dragon slayers
Dragon bdsm dominators
I actually want the girl to have an internal conflict based on this
Already planning on ruining her
I thought it was gonna be the lil' boy
Since he seems to have the dragon toy
No i'm not, i'd never <:eyes:1095067293261770802>
So I thought he was the one who liked them
Nah, he is actually taught to keep them hostage
It was given him to practice killing dragons
But then again he could just use those toys to dismantle them like a psycho XD
xD
Yes
Exactly
Like when a puppy has his first killing instincs kick in
Imagine someone having toys of sentient beings who are people and then it turns out he loves fucking up those toys, thinking one day he'll get the real things
Menace
Ofc
You need Jesus
Animate object
I wasn't the one who bought the red dragon toy for my child, as a dragon hunter
Daddy kills those people, sweetie
XD
I find it more grim and funny
The kid actually has a tiny little blunt replica of the original Qan-Lar too, he got it with the dragon
Stab
XD
*pokes dads eye out*
Natural selection
"Daddy is a dragon hunter. He kills those evil ones, like the one in your hand."
*Kid starts aggressively stabbing and tearing the toy apart.*
*Scorpio grins like a maniac*
And this is how you teach your kids to be inherently racist XD
xDDD
*Because there are surely no good red dragons at all*
Imagine you being a good red dragon and just coming across some hero wannabe who wants to stab you on sight XD
Bonus point if they approach you with a sinister grin
Aren is back XD
*i definetly don't have a city in aurixen with a non-evil red dragon official nooooo
He killed Aren just for one of his kids to become like Aren
I can already see a really good story potential, where the girl tells Scorpio that she loves dragons so much she wants to be like them, imagine the conflict between the girl, Scorpio and Qan-Lar
*Looks at what happened on Faerun the last time there was a good red dragon.*
I'm gonna start a book i think xD
\- First time?
*Conservative father and his other buddy finds out his kid is trans*
*Breaks daughters neck*
\- Lucky we only ever had a son.
Yria would probably snap his ass then XD
STFU XD HE'D NEVER DO THAT WTF XD
A trans dragon
Daugthe identifies as dragon
Becomes one
*It's not just a phase, **daaaad!** *
*demi dragon through willing transition*
My Dragon Daughter

Okay we might use the top left design idea somewhere else, but top right is the golem you gonna get fucked by
```They are not dumb, they are honest.```

*Figyelmesen k�veti Grei �tleteit azt�n a v�g�n mosolyogva fel�ll, odas�t�l hozz�, le�l mell�, megfogja a kezeit, azt is amiben im�nt az �rm�j�t p�rgette, �s l�gyan azt mondja neki:*
- **Nem.** 
*Nem haragszik Greire hisz tudja, nem akar rosszat.*
- Holl�csk�m, nagyon �r�l�k hogy seg�teni szeretn�l nek�nk, �s annak is hogy m�giscsak foglalkozn�l a gyerk�ccel, vagy t�bbel is, de se nem �letk�pess�gi sk�la alapj�n szeretn�k gyereket v�lasztani, se nem akarom ha kis korukban annak lenn�nek al�vetve mint amin neked, vagy nekem kellett �tesn�nk. *Mondja m�r t�lzottan �des hangs�lyban, direkt az�rt hogy Greit egy kicsit piszk�lja.*
- Sz�val nem, nem �gy akarom, de az�rt ha m�r el�g id�s lesz,... lesznek, �s megvan r� a kell� fizikumuk, k�szs�g�k, kedv�k, akkor sz�vesen r�d b�zom hogy megtan�tsd �ket a v�rosi fort�lyaidra, m�g ak�r azokra a halad� harcitechnik�kra is amik a te harcst�lusodhoz kapcsol�dnak.

Hmm this room would very quickly be unreadable like this soooo
Construct (Brute)
Let's continue the construct talk here
Creature: The Oracle
.
Creature: Aspect Guard
.
Creature: Construct (Brute)
Map: Portal
.
Help it's 3am and I'm watching a video about the game design choices of the actual game that is in the Hunger Games movie xd
***fuck***
I have been deceived into learning game programming
So the is a twisted version of the material plane, I can imagine stuff like random elements filling areas they don't truly belong but the overall "vibe" is still pretty normal to what you'd expect in the world.

The place where this gate/portal is to the Architect's plane is something that is hidden and hard to find rather than well protected or fortified. Yet some defenders were obviously ready and waiting which turned into the current battle that's brewing there and into which the players will be teleported into
I can also imagine maybe some influence of the Architect's plane leaking into the material plane through the gateway
The one I can imagine probably the best would be a hidden valley or hard to reach mountain crevice/open cave
Size-wise I would imagine a 40x40 (square, aka 200x200 ft) area would be more than most players would make a use out of but would still allow running around or so when it comes to that
When Nika is done with the constructs and guards some already dead ones would probably also add to the show how it is an ongoing battle
As well as marks that such machines would leave during their fights, like a broken tree here or a smashed rock there dunno
Feel free to add 3d dimension to the map too, maybe some parts are elevated and such or have a ridge etc
I'll ofc leave a lot to them actual graphics design master minds cus yea
Oh also, don't forget: *foundry can deal with (light) animations on the map as a repeating .gif
But if you want to go for that a static version would be also very good to have so up to you
Oh and lighting should be handled by foundry, if you put a lit candle somewhere and place it's light too then placing a foundry light source that will effect tokens and such will just make it too bright
Will most probably be a blind monk, but we'll get to this one construct bois are done
Will be a fairly elite looking but obviously a category below both the Oracle and the constructs/other creatures that will be in the adventure
soooo...... Trump just announced DOGE department....
we truly live in the "best" timeline of the world
And you can guess who's idea was the name if Elon Musk will be one of the 2 heads of the department \:D
Elon the cool kid Muskrat
ngl, still not a fan of how much they drag out each episode
though I guess that's simply a given
having an annoying host can also be aids <:Cattostare:1154686930403987536>
-Hmmmm....Placement test....Hmmm...the strongest survive....hmmmm.... *Sindor m�ly gondolkod�sba zuhan.*

I crave irl games so valszeg n�lunk lenne majd veszpr�mben �s valszeg felv�ltva GM-kedn�nk M�rkkal (to help with burnout and managing sessions).
Chains lenne amit szeretn�k els�re ind�tani majd.
It might be a bit depressing, but it is an epic edgefest so it equals itself out.

for a short while
I hope it is not overscoped, it shouldn't be
I'd elbow him in the jaw if I was her xDD
XDDDD
I can imagine the boy having a good friendship with Grei xD
Uncle Grei xD
*A big boom in the background.*
Some citizen of Mulandir: "It's the stripey kid again hanging out with Grei" *sigh*
Scorpio: "Please stop teaching the kid unethical ways of murder"
*Kid running off in the backround with a makeshift horrifying spiked blunt weapon.*
Grei: "Oops, too late."
Scorpio: *sigh*
I'm having fun xD
so whats their name btw?
Yrio �s Scorpia
XD
Didn't figure it out yet :c
Nem
XD

*They sure do look like clones* XD
Tedd le �s Vedd fel
The boy looks like a washed out Scorpio
Different hairstyle
But to be fair
Some people do look like their parents to a t
I don't think so xD Scorpio originally is pale af, the boy looks healthy xD
Reverse washed out
Getting color
*and has a blueish tint to his skin
But Scorpio is blue
Yeah
Sadly i didn't manage to stay consistent with my drawings xD

I have to agree with the girl tho xD
His father is technically a .ass murderer of highly sentient being
And the other kid just laughs about it xD
*My dad is the coolest serial killer ever!*
XD
Yes xD
So raiders?
To be fair, he's forced to murder, and he knly murders evil dragons or ones he got reports of from the military that's needed to be neutralized xD
Forced? Didn't **he** want the super dragon killer weapon replica of himself?

idk
dad is getting a little out of hand
i think
with the drinking more like
R�szoltak Reg�re amire abba is hagyta
And he still became angry enough to leave and sulk on the streets for half an hour
Nekem ez a legfur�bb
Sz�mukra k�nyelmetlen volt l�tni. Sure I can understand. I had GF's where the parents didn't like us being physical in their presence.
But when they told me or her to please stop we did amd that was it
but getting angry over it is DUMB
Everyone calmed down
Ah
Yes. Ott v�ge kellett volna lennie a sztorinak, hogy Reg� halgatott r�juk mikor megk�rt�k.
*Scorpio, �s olyanok seg�ts�g�vel akik m�r j�rtak a Temple of the Leviathan nev� monostorban elteleport�l oda, bebocs�jt�st k�r a Sorcha feles�ge �ltal �rt �s al��rt lev�lnek bemutat�s�val, �s megk�ri hogy vezess�k hozz�. Amikor a szob�j�ba �rnek, kifejti az ott l�v�knek hogy minden amit Sorcha �ll�tott, ami�rt ide k�ldt�k kezel�sre, igaz volt, �s � most az�rt �rkezett hogy ism�t egyes�tse lelk�t a test�vel, majd neki is l�t a m�veletnek. Miut�n sikeresen elv�gezte, let�rdel a halfling polg�rmester el�tt, �s lehajtott fejjel, de szemkontaktust tartva elsz�mol arr�l amit tett, valamint igyekszik elmagyar�zni szerencs�tlen helyzet�t, ami miatt ezen kellett �tesni�k. Nem k�ri hogy bocs�sson neki meg, csak azt hogy ne mondja el a falusiaknak, mert nem akarja a csal�dja j� nev�t bemocskolni. Ne �gy gondoljanak r�juk, mint azok akik sz�vesen l�tj�k azt az alakot, aki meggyilkolta a polg�rmester�ket. M�g ha nem is adja meg neki ezt a sz�vess�get neki a halfling, �gyis hazaviszi a feles�g�hez, gyerekeihez, any�s�hoz.*
nah he didnt
he was quite agressive with me
not directly but with his tone
and i heard him cursing in the kitchen
I was talking about my experiences
oh
well
I know he didn't
He was passive agressive even after he came back
He didn't even look at Mark.
idk
i dont feel comfortable now at all
(But he did ask me if I'd like another glass of wine)
eh

I guess I have tomorrow's program
I think I'm starting at the wrong end lol
I'm gonna photograph the pages and make a diy ebook

It was on sale at the online bookstore

Good thing that you can move out soon
*In the depths of Nessus, I sit upon my throne, watching the Great Wheel turn. Every soul, every heartbeat, every fleeting thought is like a delicate note in the symphony of existence. But oh, there is one sensation, one exquisite pleasure that eclipses all others: the corruption of a pure soul.
 Can you imagine? That moment when innocence fractures, when a soul�s core becomes tainted with the intoxicating taste of sin? That delectable descent into the dark? Many view me as a creature of sheer malevolence, but they fail to understand. It�s not about the pain, the torment, or the eternal damnation. It�s about the seduction. The transformation.
 I invite you, brave adventurers, to try and resist my allure. But remember, every choice you make, I will be watching. Waiting. Because there is no pleasure greater, no triumph more profound, than turning the most steadfast and noble of souls into my devoted, corrupted playthings.*

And with this message from the big man himself out of the way, I'd like to welcome you all as well. The campaign might not start in the next few days, but it's close enough for us to make a room for it. You guys will have a lot of time to make your characters and flesh out their backstories (that you will see coming back during the adventure). I'll drop every information you might need for the creation of your Damned or Savior right here.
- Ruleset: D&D 5e24
- Races: Any available in PHB
- Classes: Any available in PHB
- Level: 11th
- Stat generation: Point Buy
- Type of Soul: This will outline the basic ideas of your story and your benefits (or punishments) along the way.
- - Saviors of Lost Souls: You go down to the 9 hells in a selfless act, to save a loved one of yours, who signed an infernal contract.
- - Souls of the Damned: You go down to the 9 hells in a selfish act, to save your own soul after it has found it's way there, for the sins you've commited.
- Type of Sin: This will give you the sin that brought you or your loved one to the Nine hells.
- - Sins of the Other: Betrayal, Deceit, Harm, Murder, Oppression
- - Sins of the Self: Anger, Greed, Jealousy, Pride
- Magical Equipment: Your adventurer aquired these magic items during their exploits before this adventure. These items can be chosen from the 5e24 DMs Guide. Pick one of the option bellow:
- - 1 Very Rare and 1 Uncommon Magic Item
- - 2 Rare Magic Items
- Story: Go nuts, just remember that your character already had the power to bend the world around them to their own will. You were great heroes or great villains even before this trip to the Lower Planes. I'll try to use as much from this as humanly possible. The book also has options for "premade" story beats, if you're interested hit me up and I'll show you whatever might interest you. 
- Group Patrons: These are the people sponsoring your descent into the 9 Hells.
- - Hellriders of Elturel: Good aligned option. Your contact is Ramius Dangremond, the commander of the faction.
- - Conclave of Halruaa: Neutral aligned option. Your contact is Zythan Avhoste, the High Diviner of Halruaa.
- - Deathstalkers of Bhaal: Evil aligned option. Your contact is Sarevok Anchev, the last Bhaalspawn.

*Halkan kuncog az abszurd felvet�seken a gyereknevel�ssel kapcsolatban majd � is Greihez l�p �s megsimogatja v�ll�t.*
- Az�rt �r�l�k hogy valamennyire kezd �rdekelni a dolog, de egyet�rtek Ardennel hogy a shadowfell-i nevel�si taktik�kat val�sz�n�leg �rdemes a shadowfellben hagyni hisz itteni �letre akarjuk nevelni, nem egy �r�k *hal�ltus�ra* egy veszedelmes s�kon.
*Ezut�n Ardenre emeli tekintet�t.*

- De az�rt nem mondom azt hogy a j�v�ben nem �rdekelne egy "v�rszerinti" ut�d.. *Kicsit megvakarja tark�j�t.*

Gotta say kicsit tel�t�dik a szerver xd
Nekem kezd kicsit sok lenni
yea understandable, de ahogy mondtam, ezekr�l basically akkor tudsz amikor bel�pnek vagy ha j�tszassz vel�k
I guess
De �pp ez az i think
hm?
I don't like the big server feel
We don't know most of the people here anymore
Most of us don't even interact
ye, de nem is l�tjuk �ket xd. mondjuk ez is fura lehet benne
I feel that'd need a different server
like akkor m�r legyen blobar szerver
lets mingle
I don't like that constantly random people are brought in
But I guess that's just server things xd
Pls no xd
yea nah it is a pretty small private server just not like, 10 ppl small
Maybe a separate global server sure
well sadly its not that kind of server anymore. its not just a friendgroup but multiple. although i think like 80% of the people dont even watch this server on a dialy
:c
I honestly don't care, I just don't like it xd
Private my ass
Idk
he means its not on disclink or anything
I guess we never see them sure
people cant actually just find an invite
M�g j� xD

Keep it that way xD
yea I am dw
Nothin against the people comin in
as I said, private, aka not out publicly
It's just a lot
Eh
Mondjuk a trusted fella emberek �gy is kevesen vannak
So that's gud
I'll cope xdd
at this point I'm only putting trusted fella on peeps that are known by most of the csudapest folk
I'm not taking away previous ones but ye
Yea
Do we adopt <@332925665424834560> for szilveszter, she doesn't have an invinte to anywhere yet
Depends on Nika mostly as we'll be at her place
Ah ye
I wouldn't mind \:D
I was about to say I wouldn't mind either
I can already barely host yall with the tiny little space i have
oh yea space
oh
well rip
Well damn
I think i'll play a mercy monk
That sounds epic
And works with my vague idea xD
What is your vague idea?

tbh it might not actually launch now, I will definitely make the test combat so I can get the feel for the powerlevels
but yea
we'll see
Time to make isometric maps for architect then xDD
nah, Architect will be put out to be sold, isometric would be just an optional thing for it when it is done

Clarification on choosing a sin: You only need to choose one, and that is for the soul you are saving (your loved one's if you are a savior, or your own sin if you're saving yourself)
The sin of self and sin of the other is just a grouping of them depending on who suffers because of it, not a grouping on which group can choose it.
So tiny he has to chew a fruit fly
I already recieved a character
Guys
whoes??
I already got a full backstory to one of the characters
ooh
Hey
:D
Why I don't put out games before they start lol
thought so
Tell them how messed up it is xD
Okay, it *is* messed up, but not *that* messed up
(they said they want to rp a bit after the end)
(or like, mostly Anna but ye xd)
It's kinda messed up
Messed up enough to fit into the hells
You're really close to play damned instead of savior tho xD
>:)
*Austin has no recollection how he got here, no idea what time it is or where this place is. He only knows one thing... That this metal table is really cold for his back.*
<@618475228695232532>
Best gobbo
*His eyes spring open as the cold sensation of the metal surface flushes over his body, awakening him fully. The lack of memory does not stir him any kind of way, since it has been a familiar feeling for him he had to get use to over the centuries. With a pounding head he gets up and looks around.*
Literally

Gleep glorp lookin ahh car
*He finds himself in a room that looks kind of familiar, but he was always on the other end of the deal... A torture room. It seems entirely empty, aside from the blood the elf stepped in. His own blood, from a huge scar on his side. It starts at his hipbone, going over his ribs right to the collarbone on the other side. It seems neetly done, but as he woke a few sutures broke.*
<@&1209957580164702270> 
I will have a quick 10-15 mins meeting at 1900, so we start at 1915

(hehe. Fun fact about damned ones. They died.)

My character btw.
(Csak el�r�l van v�g�s vagy konkr�ten f�lbe lett v�gva?)
(Ahogy szeretn�d
(Akkor csak a t�rzse)
*He looks over himself as the metallic scent of his own blood cuts through his nostrils as his hands map over his body to inspect the huge scar across his torso. A fleeting thought catches him as his fingers smeer the blood from his chest.* -Hm....sloppy. *His deep, unimpressed, rusty voice bounces off the walls of the room. He scans the place with his lifeless, experienced, weary eyes that have seen so much.*
( <@520697326679883808> )
(Time for some grade A edge)
(Yupp)
*The moment he tries to look around he feels the recognisible cold edge of a blade on his neck. With a deep raspy voice the man behind him starts speaking.*
\- I did my best.
(Oh now i have to be very tricky, huh)
Amazing xDDDD
(Now i dont know hogy mi legyen. AT or Assassin?)
https://tenor.com/view/dillom-rage-dog-angry-dog-gif-17954176246139200797
My character
*His respons is immediat.* -And now you would ruin your handy work? Where am I? *He is stern and cold, slowly turning his head to see who patched him up so neatly.*
(don't really matter, he has no focus, components or anything. But you decide)
*A bald head meets the elf, sickly gray skin, adorned with tattooes. The man pulls the dagger closer nicking the skin on Austin's neck.*
\- I'm just trying to be cautious about a dangerous man like yourself.

(He is a naled elf)
(yes. And a plates man with strong hands. Now get on your knees bitch)
(okay his statline is really dope wtf.)
-Sarevok Anchev...you mother fucker, im in!
(XDDDD(
(Mindj kit�rl�m)
*He holds an empty stare with the armoured man, knowing that he is in equal strenght if not stronger then him, set he does not seem worried by the awkward situation.* -Stipped of my personals and completely discombobulated, Im the one who should be cautious, dont you think? Especially knowing who I am facing with right now... Who killed me?
(*Looks at statline* Yeah bro. If you try him you're cooked. Not medium rare but well done.)
(Yuppp. I think Austin is aware xd. He is old enough to know i hope xd)
*He steps back releasing Austin.*
\- Does that really matter? You have bigger things to worry about, like your lack of a soul.
-Its not like I really had one to begin with. *He stats it sternly his dead expression morphs in a way that might surprise the great Bhaal spawn.* -My Lady already posesses a portion of my very being.
(EGDE)
\- Oh but if you listen closely you will hear naught. Not her voice, nor any other's. You are dead, and she has got no dominion over your soul. You my dear friend of the darker side of life... are... free.
(God damn this slaps. Only if he slapped my cheeks this hard)
*His eyes divert and he seems sunken into himself as if he is searching for something, looking inwards. This does not change his appearance by any means.* -So that is the reason I feel lighter yet more anchored then before. Where am I?
*Sarevok seems calm and waits for Asutin to come back to reality*
\- You are in my very home. This half of you that is.
*The flickering light on his eyes return just for the moment while he gounds himself and looks back at Sarevok.* -And the other half? I presume not in the upper planes.
*Sarevok starts walking towards a cabinet that he opens and steps to the side. It holds all of Austin's old gear.*
\- At least you're not delusional about being evil. A rarity nowadays. *He sighs*
\- No, your soul is in the domain of Asmodeus, and the spell that I used to bring you back only keeps you alive for a while outside of the plane your other half is held. Get ready.
-I am aware of the world enough to know that most parts in this existance, I do not belong and I have spend enough time in this life to know how far I can reach. I dont get ready. I AM ready, do not worry about that.
(So... he doesn't take his gear? XD)
(Ooh ye)

On ne passe pas!
*He walks to the cabinet to gather his gear.*
``sudo walk through``
(Don't mind this. Just sparing myself from having to scroll up in the future)
\- Well I hope that you will belong in the place where you're about to go, because I have a mission for you. I hope you gathered that a Bhaalspawn won't help you out of the goodness of his heart.
was
-And I hope you gathered that if not for your proposal and help you would be dead already? I do not take lightly when people intervien in my business.

-If not now, my next incarnation would have tracked you down if it was for me.
*A dark blade appears before Sarevok on which he calmly leans on. His voice softens but is still incredibly deep.*
- If there would be a next incarnation. You fucked up and went to hell remember? There is no next for you. There is this one where you do what I say, nodding at anything I tell you to do or I gut you like the rabid dog you are, to live your miserable eternity as a wretched lemure. Watch your tongue scum, here you are nobody. You are not a person just an investment, and believe me... My investments want to be in my best graces.
(Oooh boy his sin is about to peak through xd)
(Just remember who you're talking to alright? We don't want you to write another character XD)
(AAAAAGH yes i know. He would probably realise that he shouldnt fuck around to find out and just play along until he has the upper hand.)
*While listening, his deminour quickly shifts, his body tenses, stopping in his pace of donning his bracers. His body language takes up a more submissive pose and he looks down as Sarevoks words sink deep into him.* -M-my apologies. I might have stepped over a line, I am just merely confused and troubled by my situation. What is the deal here?
(Mind you he is almost 500 years old)
*Sarevok nods just a little*
\- You did but the apology is accepted. I'll tell you everything when the group is gathered. We're still waiting for that wizard to signal for us. To simplify everything... you want to go down to the nine hells to get your soul back and live, and I need you to do something for me down there, in exchange for giving you a fighting chance. In the meantime I'll help your little party where I am able to as... an investment is an investment. Best to keep you all alive for now right?

boys and boys with no dick
tomorrow a decieve inc party?
I mean, sure I guess no session so... XD
<:point:951578243415302235>

In case any of this was missed
In my mind it was completely connected with Angria timewarping jukes
Guess I was wrong xd
I was thinking the same, Angria is the one shifting in- and out of time&space, but the again the little fuck only appears in the hall and the corridors of that building, not in the tomb of the ghost and not outside the dungeon
Sorry if I sound frustrated or anything like that, I am not gonna lie but I am a little bit.
I thought so too, even after the recall knowledge gave us more info on it.
Ye the already difficult boss fight really didn't need another even more difficult boss on top of it so understandable xdd
And we don't have a normal frontliner in the remaining team
So that's gonna be fun xD
I will be running Angria as an NPC combatant from now on when she is away
and just timemagic her out if she would die so like
I don't accidentally lose her pc xD
(if everyone is alright with that)

Sounds gud to me <:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>

*Gathering his conscience, he now understands his position in this situation and knows that it is in his best interest to keep quiet until he has the opportunity to measure his possibilities. Even after faced with the harsh truth of his fractured being, Austin has to keep his temper and not let his confusion and anger get the better of him. He listens to Sarevok and decides to play along even if the Bhaalspawn knows he is not being genuine, though that might hardly matter to the Child of Murder.* -What is it that you need me to do for you?

First things first: this is a small place xD be ready to barely have any personal space for yourselves, as well as sleeping place
In this one-person household, I can only offer 1 set of extra bedding and a couch that can hold 2 people, 3 if they are smol
Bring sleeping-bags with you if you have that, and/or thick blankets. Some of you will have to sleep on the floor, I sadly don't have anything inflatable or extra matresses, so... yeah :) indoors camping it is xD
Bring warm pajamas/sleeping clothes. Sock are a must. Bring slippers cuz the floor is cold and full of cat hair i can't get rid of. We will heat up the apartment all day, but I can't keep the kaz�n running throughout the night cuz it's still bugged and has a stupid error that keeps the kaz�n on but the heat not going, so it'll get quite cold in here by the morning. Bring. Warm. Pajamas. Sock. Blanket.
I also can't provide food, can't cook cuz i suck at it and because i'm slowly getting out of the habit of eating, so we'll solve the food problem like real dormitory-rats, order something or just ask Daniel to cook something xD
Yall also know this but there's a little pseudodemon living with me, I do not take responsibility for whatever happens to you cuz of him  while you stay, but he is definitely getting hungrier for blood by each passing week
You all have been warned
Get ready <a:hellmage_emilyyeh:833496986657357824>
He can't take mine so he takes blood from anyone he can.
Agreed
And also. I'm not the only one who can cook in the group xD
Yes, but i'm not allowing anyone else near my kitchen hmph
Lol
You know this kitchen's drill
XD
Naah
Yeah
Fair tho
Lehet csin�lok egy rakott krumplit
Azt Endre is megeszi xD
Also mikor akar �rkezni a csapat? Dec. 30? 31?

ye


Ah yes. Messenger quality
whatever
my dog is the coal in your christmas sock
frfr
I know how to make a few foods
Rakott krumpli m�k�dik, vagy ugye a szok�sos kaja szilveszterre az a virsli mert csak tudsz b�rmikor b�rmennyit bedobni �s k�sz xd
30 is: we need to prep more but more group fun
31 is: simpler to solve

M�g nem hiszem hogy meg tudom v�laszolni �gy hirtelen
De egyik sem out-of-the-question
Reading ahead on some statblocks and god damn paizo doesn't fuck around with difficulty

<@520697326679883808>
XD

I never said online
o.o
I assume some irl talks needed proof



<@463641084971712514> you gotta use your staff more cus damn
I'll go over how it exactly works with u
I recommend looking into Spellhearts for martials
oh sry
that needs some casts too
me dumb

I've seen it described as "one party wants to kill you, and the other party just advertises that it's not the party that wants to kill you"

Its only wierd if you make it
I like the staffs
We could go over them sure
In case they are more epic than I thought xD
Just usually the spells I have in them are not great for the fights we have cause the frontline is already at the front, and the spell has a 15 foot cone xD
But I do like dragons breath
If I get the chance imma use it for sure
after reading the top comment chain, I have decided it is enough reddit for today https://www.reddit.com/r/EatItYouFuckinCoward/s/xhkG6TADXN
Ah I see
I'm pretty sure you can aim it well enough xd
If they stand in it then too bad so sad xDD
I can highly recommend the concept of teamwork xD
You can mention that you are looking to aoe so they can adjust
XD
Or maybe even help you set up by tripping the enemy or putting some other debuff up
Now why would I do that when it's so fun to see the enemy succeed and my team fail the rolls xDDD
Understandable
Have a nice funeral
But yea fair
<:point:951578243415302235>
Set up would be nice indeed
I shall use this so called *teamwork* I guess
Might be beneficial <:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
I think you are limiting yourself way too much worrying about saving throws.
But they always succeed xdd
However
Now I've took up some nice debuff spells
Even if they succeed they'll be slightly fucked
And not just take like 3 dmg or smth as with my damage spells xDD
Also if we'll have some downtime I'd like to retrain some spells
Imma rework my repertoire to be better xd
Also question for da team
Which conditions would be our biggest concern?
Cause I can choose a list of a few conditions I could remove with my lay on hands
Mercy of the Body: blinded, dazzled, deafened, enfeebled, sickened; 
Mercy of Grace: clumsy, grabbed, paralyzed; 
Mercy of the Mind: fleeing, frightened, stupefied
Currently I have the Mercy of the Mind set, but I'd do like some input
(once I'm home imma take a look at the conditions I could lessen already)
The party is full of martials so I think Body's conditions are a bit worse for us.
Those hurt Angria, Dundee, Wolf and they hurt Bran too. Grace is also bad as is Mind but hm.
We need input from the others as well
It's just my 2 cents


https://x.com/Just_Kulu/status/1860509574295441699


wadafuq is thaf
So i thought i had other conditions i can take care of
but no xDD
ye but those are usually fortitude save no?
and thats better for ya
(?)
blinded (usually Fortitude): bad for everyone
dazzled (Fort): bad for everyone
enfeebled (Fort): bad for Dundee, Angria
clumsy (Fort or Will): bad for Bran, Wolf
grabbed (Fort or Ref): mostly Dundee and Angria will face it
paralyzed: dunno never saw it yet xd
fleeing (Will): bad for everyone
frightened (Will): bad for everyone
stupefied (Will): bad for Pyre
Oh fair yeah
<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
Man
i like whispers of weakness oracle feat
i can get the weaknesses of an enemy and its lowest save
from one action
but i could also take treat condition instead
and then i could use it with doctors visitation
for clumsy, enfeebled and sickened
*hmm*
later with holistic care feat frightened, stupefied, and stunned are added also
on 10th lvl to the mery of mind i could add confused and controlled
thats quite a bit away tho xDD
*eeeee*
it is the very end XD
the game goes till 10th
yeaa
what are the immunities of sam?
The question really comes down to what we fear most
(blinded, dazzled) or (grabbed, paralyzed) or (fleeing, frightened)
check construct immunities
cant be paralyzed or sickened
those are the only relevant ones here
so didnt help much xD
xD
might take mercy of the body after all
we shall see

Some great comments on this one
<@&1209957580164702270> sleepless night, I'll try to rest some between classes and the session, no promises
I didn't sleep much either. Was kept alive by someone who slept 5 hours in the afternoon.
Why did you allow him to sleep? Smh
I wasn't home
You know that's a mistake
Big uff
The first wild perkele I have seen
XD
8am biking moment
So who is going to be in the team??
<:eedawg:1242969529961812020>
I meanthe obviously lawful paladin
Still confused xD
Why?
I don't understand, you're switching character? Or who is that? I don't know of a lawful paladin character joining the party xddd
Im asking yall
Reg� is interested who's bringing the paladin
Cuz so far it seems we dont have anyone lawful good in the party xd
Cuz Bence is thinking about it but so is M�rk and maybe even �gi as well.
Tho these paladin ideas
I don't remember any of them being lawful good xD i may be wrong tho
I wouldnt mind seeing a zeuss tho
It'd be fun
Tho �gi said Zeuss' story is kinda written
Or somethin like that
Yes
Very sad
I mean. 1 paladin is good, 2-3 paladins are never bad xD
Does anyone want to be my dnd girlfriend?
Oh no
I thought you already tamed that bhaalspawn or whatever :3
I wouldnt say
https://tenor.com/view/ateez-mingi-mingi-ateez-ateez-mingi-reaction-gif-gif-2986532869397027850
Specially if they believe in different things. Just Imagine religion clash in the party
That�d be like
*Holy Hell*
Hell upon the Hells
<:oriolussideeye:1239921069633048687>
Let it all burn tbh
<a:hellmage_emilyyeh:833496986657357824>
<:oriolussideeye:1239921069633048687>
<:oriolussideeye:1239921069633048687>
That would be xx
Also idk how serious the game is going to be in means of roleplay
So might worth knowing who os aiming for what
I'm looking forward to heavy rps
So we dont end up upsetting each other
Alright
I'm gonna be hyperfocused of my character, this'll be my only game as a player
I wanna take it seriously, i mean the rp
I'll try my best but no promises
I've been very out of rp lately
But on sessions it should be fine
In session ofc
Alright
On session sure! Will try playing the fanatic I'm planning well and such. Out of session, just to be safe I'll say I don't see much chance at rp-s

My bike froze
Like
I can't rotate the wheel with all my strength froze xd

So what's the plan now? xd
I brought it inside, so it can melt
And wrote msg to teacher
They'll understand as there is a warning out about the flash freeze that shops can't restock for the next few days
Understandable xd
Do others cover their bikes to prevent this?
Or
Is there like no way to prevent this xdd
Well I was biking during the melt
*u just fucked no matter what*
Which was probably bad idea
I see

Oh god oh no oh fuck
Walking into uni with this was funny xd
(the essentials bag for weekend travel)
kellett egy temporary tax card hogy goverment project munk�b�l kapjak egy kis p�nzt (kb 150 euro)

tax card arrives
letter has numbers like
"projected income (yearly): 150_000 euro"
and
"taxable income (yearly): 10_000 euro"

and I was like HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH?!
but that is just the maximum
xDDD
a 150 eur�b�l majd 11.92 megy tax-ra lul
xD
7.9%
that sounds pretty low
Look at this baby
mi�rt nem csin�lsz pl�ss businesst?
I could :3
De nem hiszem hogy nagyon m�k�dne
Absolutely m�k�dne xd
persze hogy m�k�dne
*i love this baby*
m�g ha csak gyerekeknek csin�lod
Nem csak gyerekeknek venn�k im quite sure xD
Btw nem ti vagytok az els�k akik piacra akarn�k k�ldeni a pl�sseimet xD
�gy �rthet�bb :DD
Ey nice :D
csak j� marketing kell
ennyi
Wha xD
meg ki kell j�rni helyekre �rulni
mindegy
~~||yes hype up an artist to try and start a business in the middle of an economic crisis, that gonna work well||~~
tbh, might work just don't invest too much into it at first and most importantly don't take out a loan
any loan will insanely reck you in a global regression :D
Not really hyping to make a business xd
Just sell em
Either just individually
Or with a drop system so when she has a few she puts em up for sale in a bunch
Dice makers often do that
When they got enough stuff they just put it up somewhere
Meg lehetne n�zni mennyi egy booth ilyen kar�csonyi v�s�ron or smth xD
a lot probably
Possibly ye
Crochet amigurumi artists do the same too
<:point:951578243415302235>
Fun lenne ki�lni egy vas�rnapi piacra tho xD csak yeah dr�ga valszeg egy booth
�n is arra gondoltam
Nem hiszem hogy ind�tan�k proper businesst, de �gy nem lenne rossz
Lengyelpiacra ki�lni asszem nem durva
szerintem a zircire gondolt
de az sem rossz
Same difference
Piac piac xD
Csak ha van booth akkor probs dr�g�bb
Das true
Egy lengyelpiacra valszeg t�bb plushie k�ne mint 5-8 db xddd
Kimegy�nk egy�tt egy rakat k�zm�ves cuccal
Easy xD
sim�n
*�
Plussies, stickers, etc
K�z�sen foglalni egy booth-ot
Would be fun
:3
Egyszer fun lenne, just for shits and giggle xD
:3
Yiss :3

*had my first "oh I know what it means in Finnish, however I forgot* ***both the Hungarian and English***

I'm blissfully ignoring the fact that the "spoken Finnish" exists and is different from formal (/written) Finnish

(red dot means it's the spoken version)
And I will keep ignoring it for a while

Where (is)? = Miss�? = Hol?
Where (to)? = Mihin? = Hova?
Where (from) = Mist�? = Honnan?

you can see how the base of the language is so much closer to hungarian than to english in all the little ways



Yes
I wouldnt say to look down on everyone in order to deliever a confident speeche or presentation
But like treat everyone a little less then you think they are

I could write 86% of the Finnish words without grammar mistakes
There was like 5 I actually didn't know
Oh?
niiice
good job
how does speaking going? :DD
Pronunciation is super easy as long as I'm going for understandable and not perfect
They say every letter like Hungarians
� is between A and � just a bit more throat-y
Y is literally �


Whoever seen the anime will understand (I needed an explanation so, which is basically in short it's that ||these two characters have a very sad moment where they fuse together||)

Behind glossy purple veils lies a ballroom large enough to host at least a hundred people, not counting the space occupied by the small stage and two long tables set with various alcohols and snacks for the guests to enjoy. Each window on the longer parallel walls are hidden behind silky violet curtains, hanging from golden cornices. From the ceiling high above, a golden chandelier the size of a wardrobe hangs, decorated with amethyst stones and holding black candles to provide a warm atmosphere for the place. The dark grey tiles reflect each little light source with perfect mirror shine, yet the floor is barely slippery; perfect to dance on. A few chairs are scattered close to the stage, where at the moment three bards are playing classical songs and waltzes for the folks to dance to. Guests from many different noble houses are present, each chattering with one-another while holding their favourite drinks in hands.
A tall, well built elven man - seemingly the host of tonight's party - stands out from the crowd with a suit made of rare fabrics that's decorated with golden jewelry of uncommon motifs. He's having a conversation with a woman dressed in an outfit that has similar ornaments the host's clothes; the two are likely related to each other, maybe the woman is his wife. Looking through the crowd, several other, younger elves with the same outfit aesthetics are scattered around the ballroom; two young men, two kids and two young women. Each seem to be busy talking with guests of their ages, except for one; the girl who seems the oldest, and most mature among the six, is sipping on a glass of fine, red wine, listening to the bards while curiously watching the crowd with an analyzing gaze.
The ballroom is not full... there are still people who haven't arrived yet.

(Is she sitting?)
(Let's say yes)
(Who is she the closest to?)
(She's probably sitting alone, maybe strangers are closer to her)
(She's close to, but not next to, the stage)
*The eldest's wandering eyes can sense nothing out of the ordinary. The gloomy and serene ambiance of the grand hall with the opulent interior decor reassures the elf of the security of prestiege and status in her heart. She is in a safe space that gives her calmness.*
(Ill continue sry)
(I just have something going on)
(There you go)
https://youtube.com/shorts/RBfjZFzkPio?si=L3f2LlmPBWqaEjLL
*The blonde lets out a barely audible sigh as she glances down into her glass of wine.*
� I would much rather be in the study or in the training hall... at least that would be productive.
*She lifts the glass to her lips, sipping a small amount of her alcohol.*
� But perhaps today is a lucky day, and I won't get bored too quickly...
*The violet dress hugging her figure gently unfolds from her lap as she stands up, the great amount of fabric falling to the ground in one, swift motion. The tattoo that covers her entire back reveals itself to be covering her shoulders and neck too as she turns, being in high contrast with her ashen skin. She lays her vibrant, blood red eyes on the owner of the mysterious voice.*
� ...An honor to meet you.
*She bows just as much as noble rules dictate in the books. Even though she's small, her presence radiates confidence and dignity, though it is mixed with curiosity, hoping she might have found someone who's not just a regular boring noble with whom she could only do boring small talk with.*

<https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=750>

**No 2. - Time Easing**
You can ask for an easier DC for a check if you decide to take more time with it. How much time you need is based on the situation, decided by the GM. You can get a -1 or -2 on the DC of a check with this.

**No 3. - Keeley's Hero Point Rule**
If the natural die result of a Hero Point reroll would be below 10, a bonus of 10 is added to the sum of the roll afterwards.

Notes:
- This is automated
- Natural 1 still has it's special effect of lowering the outcome of the check by one.

**No 4. - Rattax**
Nils has to present with a picture or video footage that Jerry is playing with him or lose their starting 1 hero point for the session.
- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |  -
**Recall Knowledge Clarifications and Examples**
How to use recall knowledge about creatures in an encounter:
1. Spend the Action
2. Ask a question about a creature
3. Roll the check
4. On success you get the answer to the information you asked. On critical success you get the answer and afterwards you can ask an additional question and get the answer to that.

Example questions:
- What is the lowest save of the creature? (you get which save, not the value)
- Is the creature's AC higher/lower/equal to mine?
- Which is the highest resistance of the creature? (you get which resistance, not the value)
- Which is the highest vulnerability of the creature? (you get which save, not the value)
- What are their resistances/vul/immu? (you know the resistances/vul/immu but not their values)
- Does the creature have vulnerability/resistance/immunity to x damage type or condition.
- Tell me about reaction they have? (this would look like "they can react to creatures moving nearby it" or "it is keeping up an escape for itself in case it gets into trouble")
- A notable ability they might have?

Oh yea, important: every message is saved on this server, admins can check back any edited or deleted message
*The elf man follows him suit to the drinking table and as while listening to the young, noble's speech he grabs a glass too, even if only to be polite. He swirls it in his strong yet seemingly delicate hand and snickers.* -Well, I suppose I have an eye for finding the crow jewel of the occasion. *There is a twinkle in his eyes for a second that is suspeciously sly but it might just to match the vibe of his talking partner.* -I have heard of your grandmother. *He nods confidentially.* -Some say she was a force to be reckoned with. But others might disagree with that.

Idk what this game is but it is free rn https://store.steampowered.com/app/418670/Pankapu/
Who is free and in VP today?
Not today, sadly
Not yet

Be real, how many of you would fall for this?
Eddig sosem k�rt t�lem m�st, csak hogy pip�ljam ki a ,,Nem vagyok robot" rubrik�t, vagy v�lasszak ki k�peket a k�vetelm�ny alapaj�n, so I don't think I would
You can't make me press these buttons, in that order
Btw basically a short explanation:
1) you click the "verify not a robit" thing, this copies badbad evil code as just text into your keyboard
2) you press Windows + R which opens the run window (anything you write in it will run as code)
3) make you paste the evil evil code and press enter to run it
Cock
Very mature
Whats this evil code??
Could be anything, from stuff that saves any password you typed to stuff that straight up hijacks your computer
what if it just wants to give me a kiss though :3

Where you'll be is your choice man. We won't force you to come, but the gifting is still in progress so at least come for that.
az mindenk�pp meg lenne oldva
Yes l�gy ott ahol szeretn�l, nem k�telez� vel�nk cs�v�lni, csak a secret santat oldjuk meg �gy hogy mindenki jelen van :D
also you know im lowkey scared of Gandalf

o7
Yepp xD
I would die
without yt premium
the only thing keeping me sane
yep
I would never pay youtube for shit
I'd rather endure idc xD
why?
what else is there that you use this much?
Bc I don't want to
fair
for me like
I use it an average of 12 hours a day so ehm
yea at that point
not paying for it would be fucking sad
I'm not willing to pour money into something like this
Doesn't bother me enough
Yet xD
But the more they try the more spiteful I'll be so
Never payin em for shit xD
And u don't really like monthly subscriptions tbh
I'm fine with them as long as it is something that actually needs upkeep
you are using monthly subscription to your public transport
the monthly ticket thing (I do make an assumption here that you do have that XD)
Nah being a wrestle bro is different compared to smelling of the gay near a homophobe apex predator.
XD
I mean ye but that doesn't automatically get taken from my account xd
I can just not buy it without having to unsubscribe
Which can be a pain in the ass
If the company is garbage xd
*bc capitalism*
XD
XD
Didn't assert enough dominance, you are prey now
1. yea, don't subscribe to trash companies
2. put them on different bank account thingies so it just auto declines
xD
Fair enough xd
but I can see it being annoying
I don't have different bank account thingies
And managing that sounds like a hassle
btw good news
new consumer protection thingy is coming which will force companies to have easy to access 2-click unsubscribe
(the unsubscribe button + an are you sure pop-up, neither of them can be misleading)
Yupp
Each month putting the exact amount on needed xd
Speaking of which
Did you put him in his place or did you retreat when he attacked?
Veeery noice
I woke up to this
*get consumed*
<:potatgandalf:1266340860585312338>
yea, basically the same work as going and buying the monthly ticket
Ye he was still like a statue. Just having me between his jaws
He didn't move
But eyed me like a predator
I'd surely forget, I just know it xD
And i took my pictures xD
yea xD
I usually set remminders to unsubscribe in case I don't want to be subscribed
Cumi lett�l
Bite for comfort
Ye that'd probably be my play too
Without that I'd forgor xD

*The noble girl darts her eyes at the party's real host; the well groomed and dressed, powerful looking man a few tables away. Then, she too takes a drink, her signet ring clinking on the glass as her fingers delicately wrap around it, and raises it up to the Liadon man for a toast. Looking fiercly into his eyes, a smirk forms on her face as she replies.*
� Perhaps her unique approach to save the family's future... her attitude, her boldness. She solved both her own **and** the family's problems; she gained fame, wealth, and secured our title while reforming our traditions.
*She sighs before continuing.*
� At first however, all I knew I was bearing her name and its heavy weight with it. I felt like it was more of a duty, rather than a desire, to become "the next Zinzana". But it grew on me over the time, and I certainly did inherit her talents.
*A cocky smirk flashes across her face, but it's gone in an instant.*
� What is better than a noble who not only knows, but *loves* what they are doing?
I just aquired a party game

yes as everyone knows alkoholfri = 0.5%
xD
Yes absolutely xDD

In finland 0.5 g/l is the blood alcohol concentration level that they allow you to still drive with so... 0.5 drink is kind of alright free XD
Btw ilyen folyad�kot lehet g�pre vinni?
oh my god I'm dying. In Denmark one of the constitutional laws states that if the sea between Denmark and Sweden freezes, any Danish is allowed to beat any Swede that crosses the ice on foot XD

*and what if they are not on foot*
Until they leave
check-in luggage-ban yes
It's legal in that case
On foot is legal as well...
gud gud

you might get sticked

Eating the fine stuff like a pleb, with pleb side dish
*I was assuming at least* ***you*** *would*
It's more disappointing, sad even
All of us understood dw
Just because I go on a side tangent doesn't mean I don't get it

I mean there is like 5 of them
Maybe
But I wouldn't wanna negate the effort
Do we wanna meet up someday before the new years?
Would be nice
But when?
No idea. When the peeps are available and the flesh is willing

UP IN THE BUILDING

Ahj gyerekek nem tudom, nem szeretem a nearly-last-minute change-eket xddd
Nem tudom hova rakni az �llatot, egyed�l egy hideg lak�sban meg nincs szivem ott hagyni
Nem tudom
Idk

:/
That's kinda sad tho
Eh
im sorry, de am�gy is �n vari�lok
I guess
lol
i know
Dicey xdd
dammn
Idk Nika tudja I guess
Szerintem tal�lna a macska mag�nak meleg helyet reggelig de ya xd
Fair enough
Legut�bb is t�l�lte mikor otthon maradt szilvesztes est�re egyed�l
Az�rt annyira nem gondolom nearly last minutenek ezt
Yeah. 2 h�ttel el�re van jelezve
Lehet te t�nyleg milyen m�r a kutya miatt egyed�l szilveszterezni
Ott sincs senki aki meg tudn� s�t�ltatni este/reggel?
Mindenki elutazik, so no
Mm tudom sz�l�k mennek el, de valami ismer�s aki tudja kezelni xd
Damn :/
Az ismer�s�k meg gondolom a saj�t k�reikben �nnepelnek
Well damn
Hely szempontb�l is jobb lenne Reg��kn�l tho
Pont azon ment eddig is a vacila hogy sz�k�sen lesz�nk xd
Yeah. More place, better places to order or get stuff from. Plus outdoor things.
Ja ott is van j� kinti hely s�t�getni ha �gy esne
De csak kimenni is j�
Nagyobb konyha xD
Ha m�r f�z�s/s�t�ssel fenyegett�k �gyis Nik�t
Legal�bb nem az � konyh�j�ban "tomboln�nk" xD
This week's sunday(22)  I'd like to organize a little chriatmass themed one-shot in person, in pur beloved hometown: Veszpr�m

System: Pf2
Theme: Christmas
Special rules: -
Level: 3
Type: one-shot
Languqge: hungarian
Avalia le slots left: 3

Hook: a few unfortunate adventurers are forced to spend Yule night in a tavern, while there is a huge blizzard rageing outside. But it seems the night holds some surprises for the patrons of the Traveler's Inn
I'd like to go but that day I have a little programme in the afternoon. I don't exactly know when
Hell yes. May I take one of the spots?
When would it start approximately?
And about how long?
I got work the next day very early
Ha �gy van lehet max n�zni megyek ha azt szabad, de ha nem tart k�s� estig akkor menn�k sz�vesen <:idek:694605001502228540>
�n n�zni menn�k
Ok�, �n most �rtem haza, i'm hangry and tired, done with today, let me think on this later when i have the brain capacity
Gud idea
Rest up, and definetly eat something xd
momenta moment� XD
lehet hogy nem vas�rnap lesz ebb�l
Oof xd
mert egyszerre lett ez meg egy m�sik progi eld�ntve hogy vas�rnap lesz
�s az egyiknek mozognia kell
xDDD
XD
sz�val, uhm, <@242727379447971840> 
azzal lettem fogadva itt amikor haza�rtem hogy vas�rnap t�rsasoz�s lesz a csal�ddal itt xD
sz�val az am�g rep�ltem �s legutolj�ra besz�lt�nk lefoglal�dott
xD
now that you are homehome you can do the foodfood
(also, Nik��kn�l kikapcsol a f�t�s ha nincs senki a h�zban? o.o)
Ye
Kikapcsol ha nem nyomja be senki xd
Bekapcsolva meg nem szereti tartani mert kinda megb�zhatatlan a szerkezet
so it just goes
https://tenor.com/view/omg-hell-gif-17616758730413313573
Van egy hibak�dja ami le�ll�tja a f�t�st de futtatja tov�bb a kaz�nt
M�g a m�rkaszerviz szerel�je sem tudja mi�rt csin�lja, �s kisz�m�thatatlan mikor dobja be a k�dot
<:point:951578243415302235>
So either i turn down the f�t�s or the kaz�n does but keep running on for infinity
that sounds like it needs some good old redneck engineering
Szigszalag �s elbow grease
Meg�tni p�rszor mint egy rossz zsebl�mp�t xD
*I'm sure nothing wring can come of that*
I was thinking on a small sensor and a microcontroller attached to a button pusher piston
so if one turns off it shuts off the other one
xDDDD
Fair enough xD
https://qwertyprophecy.itch.io/mortholme
https://deconstructeam.itch.io/dear-substance-of-kin

I HAVE FOUND THE MEME I'LL PLAY
xD
Count me in good sir
<@242727379447971840> can I shop up to 125 gp for a 3rd level character? (ofc common only and you'll give a nod on it)

(total party wealth for 4 people should be 500 gp on 3rd level, so I just devided that by 4)
yes

I feel being called out by this manga

...
<:Unhingedcatoo:1154687007356899388>
That's good
The thing is, I dunno where I should go
Nem eml�kszem hol leledzetek


Az �n sz�leimn�l lesz, az nem r�mlik? XD

it's 7am, wtf is the sun doing here?
xDDDDD
https://youtu.be/jND5sau9fPg?si=x-GuS1ene3awDFEP
Fine, legyen Reg��kn�l
De nem hiszem hogy t�l kor�n fogok �rkezni hogy legyen id�m felf�teni a lak�st a Gan�nak
Meg m�snap is viszonylag earlier than others elindulok haza
I don't want to leave my son alone for too long, he'd chew himself through the walls to get a floor lower just to entertain himself
Or I could ask if he can stay here at mom's place for that night so you wouldn't have to worry about it
Get shone on bitch
```Virsly```- <@875753704685436938>
Idk, you know the cat gets very aggressive on the first nights of visit, getting him to your place for one night only would... idk, would it do good?

Valve is cracking down on season passes HARD
-food
-to be food
-is going to be food
- gayms
-opel astra 2006 tubo disel with blood red alufelni
a publisher is they want to sell a season pass have to set a strict timeline on what is included and when, they can only delay the release once by up to 3 months, if an item gets removed from the season pass steam forces them to refund that item's value from the season pass to the customers, if any part of the season pass is delayed by more than 3 months steam either enables refunds for the season pass or force refunds everyone who purchased it
oh also season pass items each need to have a proper description as:
"If you are not ready to tell the players what you are selling, you are not ready to sell it." - Steam
10/10
xDDDD
soon after Steam released this statement Ubisoft declared that they are not doing a season pass for AC: Shadows
xDDD
Nem tudom, hogy 5k-b�l milyen aut�t tudn�nk neked szerezni xD

Ez a 6-14 perfect. A d�lut�nod gyakorlatilag szabad

De 9ig? xd

9 - 5 is acceptable
Amikor k�z�psuliba mentem, �t �ven kereszt�l keltem hajnali �tkor, hogy mindent sz�pen nyugalmasan meg tudjak reggel csin�lni amit akarok

So you hop over to play from our place?
If Izzy cannot attend it can be irl

A variant of a classic joke:
"I don't care who you are or who your father is, and I don't care you're not technically swimming, this lake contains protected wildlife, so stop walking on the water."
Damn xD
Would be kinda cool ngl
Poor Izzy tho then xd
Sadly imma be with family, also my cousin's daughter will just be born at like 26th so we will have that too

lehetne ink�bb 3?
i'm (probably) having a lunch with my family at 12 and dont know if id make it back in time
Yea good
We can start arriving by 2
***I watched Moana 2***
*I have very hard Sunken Isles vibes going on*
*help*
*Start running Sunken*
*I wanna play already xD*
***I might***
*Not me inviting myself*
I already have someone else interested too ;-;
finally dnd?
lol
*I'm also assuming it wouldn't be a long campaign*
Uhm
*Managable perhaps?*
lol
I see
XD
20 * 3 or 5...
Uhm
It's like drakkenheim but it goes to 1-20
XD
*OH SO IT'S YEARS I SEE*
*WELL GODDAMN*
It might also be a weekend camping
I thought it's a nice fast lil campaign we could play before a CoS or CoA starts
Or 4pm start on weekday
*heh*
No
XD
Oh well xD
I'm not assuming too many core members if I start it anytime soon
Anyone from the CoS / CoA group who'd like to play will have to sign a paper saying they will prioritise those campaigns above this
XD
I seeee xDDDD
this might be the main limiter tho
Chains should be ready to start in mid january
yea, I'll prefer taking on ppl who only have 1 game (if CoS and CoA is counted too) or none at all
but ye I'll be careful not to steal ppl from there
cus I was told not to
xD
I think I'll only be goin to chains
and you already have alken too
I don't think I can handle cos besides that, let alone another one xDD
I don't think i could handle 2 big serious grandiose heavy campaigns at once, but if the other is more lighthearted and easygoing (*if sunken is that*), then i think i'd raise a hand to join (however i'd give my place if too many people wants to join)
*Yes*
how Sunken is (or how I want it to be) is Drakken but with PoB vibes
De cos �s chains az felv�ltva menne ha j�l eml�kszem (?)
yes
both bi-weekly
Ye
I think one should be fine for me xdddd
yea
Alken
Tails
CoS
We're OP fucks in a depressed world?
xD
I...
uhm

I wanted to be with like "not as dark grim as drakken"

So... can I play Dunald Trunp?
I wanted to give you the "I'll kill a god" background but sure whatever
Uhm... so... What changed? XD why can't you give me that background still? XD
I'll need a martial for that, not a Bard
xD
Hey. He's a bard MONK. He can dodge bullets (missiles)

Thank you DiceGod

(Get out)
This post is not for direct reqruitment but simply checking interest in playing in this campaign. Simply leave and emoji or a message about interest. The campaign would start somewhere January / February, please take into account any other campaigns or such that you'd be attending at that point, TY!

Campaign Name: Sunken Isles (third party prewritten with personal additions)
System: DnD24
Language: Hungarian OR English based on participants
Time: Either a weekday 5pm to 8-9PM (GMT+1 Budapest Time) OR sometime during weekends. Both cases weekly campaign.

Hook: A new set of islands have been discovered by some explorer's and the empires of the mainland sent a colonising expedition to bring back the riches of the isles. However these colonisers have set off the natural order of the isles and broke ancient traditions to exploit them for personal power, now the isles are dying, slowly sinking into the sea, and it is on you to save your (new) home!

But ofc
Depends on the others
Omg the lady of pain, her fancy ass mask thingy, as nutcracker

The beloved drugdealer Granny dressed in santa clothes xD
Chillin in her onsen
Omg dicegod you like the idea?
Volkan dressed as santa
He already does Santa's work in Thylea

I've been playing games for decades without using any guides, I don't get why someone would want to just copy a build

Can the server have a banner? If yes then put memedalf as a banner
N�ha viszont ott van az, amikor szeretn�l sz�rakozni, azokat az opci�kat v�lasztod amik neked j�l hangzanak, de nem �gy j�nnek ki a dolgok hogy sokszor haszn�lni tudd �ket
�s �gy a main �rz�s csak az, hogy alulteljes�tek a csapatt�rsaimhoz k�pest **�s** nem is sz�rakozom j�l, mert nem is tudom annyira kihaszn�lni a dolgokat ahogy az nekem meg�rn�
I don't look at others' builds but I also am not good at making them mayself, probably
I'll see once I'll play PF2e
Where I can build my dream character... or the nightmare that I need to wake up from Xd
Or maybe it'll just be meh
And sometimes maybe you just want to bring something else in the forefront other than the build itself
The build could just be a conduit
You just wanna know the lore, visit places, meet npcs, rp

oh nice
I might gonna give it some touch-up painting to better match the real character
Pics and close ups
It was printed sideways? O.o
Aren't these the ones that come with a first picture where the items are hidden behind something else and you need to choose based on the vibes the things on the first picture give to you?
Ah probably the cape
Yes they print all their minis sideways
Looks very cool tho. Now I wanna get one as well xD fuck
:3
2674? sz�moltad a killeket?
XDDD
the less layers the better
better to print flat(ter) things than tall lenki ones
*I'm afraid of Scorpio. He's tall and lanky*
That they printed there, because i did not add that number
He's cinnamon roll what are talking about <:zorablush:1021403403768844308> <:zorablush:1021403403768844308> <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>

*That would've been some character twist*
It's like that skit about the guy who had a crush on a girl, and  one day he slipped and fell to the floor next to her. She asked if he was okay, he wanted to say 'I'm good' or 'I'm okay' but he panicked and said 'I'm gas'

Questions
Is this a fighting oriented campaign?
Will we spend most, if not all our time on the island, wandering in the jungle and caves?
When will the adventure begin in-game? What season?
I like the decapodians so far. Specifically the Mant-I
The mant-i have 4 pairs of clawed arms... Could I even hold a weapon?
Are there stats for those natural claw weapons?
Probably
*Guess I'll have to play that monk that has astral arms*
I wish you could play large sized creatures
But no, giga shrimp is reserved only for the npcs
The one thing I find weird about these races is that the shrimps have 40 foot swimming speed, and the kiai only have 30
Even though they are described as being faster than fish
And if I remember right, mantis shrimps and lobsters aren't **that** good at swimming
They usually just vibe at the bottom of the ocean
Maybe swim backwards a little on rare occasions
Option B for a character would probably be a kia'i
I'd keep the diving suit outfit cause I definitely want that

XD
*I wanna be this guy*
Fighting and survival from what I seen so far but didn't read it fully
I think it's some festival but gotta check if it is mentioned when
Very basic primitive firearms do exist just they don't really vibe with the nature spirits xd

Na bocs�nat csak tegnap nagy halaszl� bogr�csoz�s ment
H�t akkor megk�rdezem a 28 vagy 29 kinek lenne j�
nekem b�rmelyik megfelel
29 m�k�dhetne de 30 az nekem mel� kor�n so probably passzolom most xd
M�rkkal besz�ltem �s neki m�r csak a 27 �s 31 szabad viszont 27 ink�bb pihenne. Minden m�s nap neki 12-13 �r�s m�szakok lesznek so yeah. He needs da rest.
nekem m�k�dik mindkett�
Elvileg. Ha 27.-�n elrendezz�k a lak�sos t�m�t akkor szabad leszek
de akkor lehet a 27 jobb m�gis hogy <@463641084971712514> is lehessen?
:3
�s akkor 4.nek mondjuk egy <@332925665424834560>?
ha �gy d�nt hogy abbahagyja a megf�z�st addigra
Or maybe a <@152824369805131776> even if he even wants to and is available at the time (which I don't know tbh)? <:idek:694605001502228540>

Meddig dolgozol?

# Server Lingo

Just to make listings and planning a bit more understandable some of our GMs will be using "Core" and "Light" campaigns as to describe campaign types. This mostly refers to the level of seriousness, dedication, and rule/ruling "lightness" for said campaign.

For now this is the definitions we came up with:
**Core Campaigns:** are ones with a grander more "serious" narrative, character arcs, bit more strict on rules and rulings to make it a more consistent experience.
Core campaigns usually take a lot of focus from the player and it is not recommended to have more than one core campaign you are playing in at once.
*Examples:* Chains of Asmodeus, Purity of Blood, Drakkenheim, Raiders of the Serpent Sea, Odyssey of the Dragonlords, Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden.

**Light Campaigns:** are ones that can have a loosely connected story instead of more grandeur one (although it can still be grand) with more "lighthearted fun over balanced rulings" approach.
*Examples:* Tales from the Kitsune Tail, The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, Treasure Beyond our Reflection.

This is marked in the reqruitments channel guidelines as well as the <#1006867817666191360> channel as well!

If you have any input, ideas, or questions about it please let us know!!! :D
**Session 0:** it is a special session before starting any kind of adventure. As the name suggests this happens before the first play session, during this important details about the game that will be run is discussed, what to themes to expect, what homebrew rules (if any) will be used, who will bring what type of characters, what things are players okay with in the campaign and what should be avoided (like no horror or romantic elements, etc).

Szilveszterrel kapcsolatban tov�bbra is az a terv hogy kimegy�nk t�bort�zet rakni �s ott partizunk?
Honestly i kinda just wanna stay in the warm cozy living room, f�zok eleget xd
Szerintem az nem lett el�gg� leszervezve ahhoz
s�t�lni elmehet�nk

Pedig van a k�zelben t�zrak� hely
Nem sok tervez�s kell hozz� tbh xd
But yes
Fair point
Kell h�st vennem meg p�colnom akkor �gy mondom xdd
Ye de holnap m�g nyitva vannak boltok, �s ut�na ott az eg�sz �jszaka a p�cnak �lni
Sz�val ha ma eld�ntj�k hogy menn�nk-e
Mint ahogy az eredetileg fel lett vetve
De gyan�tom �gyse megy�nk �gy ha van aki nem akar xd
Meg olcs�bban meg�sszuk
*kinda*
Ha rendel�nk akkor nem xDD
�n vettem magamnak m�r virslit
Noice <:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
Szerintem csak s�t�lni menj�nk ki a gugy�val akkort�jt amikor m�r elkezdenek t�zij�t�kozni, azt�n bent iszogassunk, meg ott is s�t�gethet�nk valamit, csak max serpeny�ben. �gy mindenkinek lesz valami
Vagyis nem tudom Fl�ki mennyire chill, vagy mennyire nem szereti a t�zij�t�kokat, sz�val akkor ahhoz igazodva menj�nk ki

I DIDNT MEAN IT LIKE THAT
*DW You'd be banned from the orgy*
XD

I am not against horny time boi, as I said I am easily as horny minded as you or Dani my man, just I don't display it

*suddenly
Mkay so if anybody wants to attend tomorrow's orgy at my place, we gather at around 11:00
uhm
Can cum earlier
I might go then but I'll be leaving to VP
I need to get papers done remember?
And you won't be coming back?
I could
Dani literally just wrote 
bureocracy > sex
smh
xD
but that will be a bit later
Like we don't have all day
I need a place to live at to have my own sex okay?
...
i mean others can host too
and since there is global warming the outside is pretty warm too
imagine Dani just phoning around next to the girl he just picked up to find a friend to host their sexy time
xDDD
i mean hotels exist
no they don't
Anna just requested their demolition
In this economy?
Also
Lehet kell majd egy tanu
Dude
Literally �n nyomtatom ki neked a papirt
Have you guys ever done it outside or in a hotel? XD
r��rek I guess
Letanuzom �n �gy mint annak a rendje
kinda?
Bej�ssz velem VP-be al��rni? XD
Mert itthon nem tudom el�re letanuzni?
no?!
XD
that is not how it works
*The next bigger bush will do, okay?*
A tanus�g literally ez ellen van XD
(Let me tell you, it is xD)
I would never sign smth like that
xD
(and you should neither)
Could work, but dunno how you living in finland would affect it. Or if it would affect it at all
I'll google it
ha kell Andrist be tudjuk szervezni lehet
vagy az Esztert
vagy a nagyim XDDD
ha m�r ott leszel melette
xD
Nincs rajta a pap�ron hogy kell-e tan�?
Csak meg tudod nyitni megn�zni
Lak�sszerz�d�shez k�telez�
De nem viszitek be a pap�rt official helyre nem? Csak miut�n minden ki van t�ltve, m�r ha beviszitek
De igen
janu�rban k�zjegyz� �tn�zi
Most csak a lak�sban fogjuk 2 tanu mellett al��rni
Ok�, de a k�zjegyz� majd csak azut�n n�zi �t hogy minden ki van t�ltve nem?
Yea na
annyi hogy be kellene rep�ln�m vissza ha baj van xDDDD
Yeah that might be an oof XD
Akkor le lehet tanuzni el�re hogy ne rabolj�tok egym�s idej�t
Mindeni �gy csin�lja
NEM
teljesen �rv�nytelen lesz a dokumentum
azonall
They are kind and all that but official papers are not something I wanna play with.
Even if they would accept it probably
You guys really overreact this xD
no, we just don't like getting fucked raw in the ass by lawyers
N�latok kik csin�ltak ilyet, hogy el�re csak �gy laz�ban?
Persze, ha hivatalos szem�ly el�tt t�ltitek ki, akkor igen akkor nem szabad
Mert el tudom k�pzelni, hogy csal�don bel�l, vagy j� csal�di bar�tokkal laz�ban csak �gy csin�lja valaki, de
Anna k�rdezi hogy mit jelentsen fel smh
xD
Randokkal
*XD Csakis*
*Mert �n azt�n h�res vagyok a bes�g�sr�l, feljelent�sr�l �s egy�b ilyen nagyon lawful cselekedetekr�l*
*Wat?*
xDD
De teszem fel, p�lda esem�ny:
A�t�t vesz Pista Sanyit�l. Sanyi jelen van, �s a 2 tan�, de Pista k�sik. Sanyi �s a tan�k elkezdik kit�lteni a pap�rt, Pista pedig f�l �r�val ut�na meg�rkezik �s befejezik egy�tt a pap�r�r�st. Ezut�n a 4 szem�ly beviszi a pap�rt a hivatalba. That's it xD i'm not talking about huge stuff
csak az sz�m�t hogy az al��r�sn�l ott van a tanu, a tanunak nem kell tudnia mi van a pap�ron meg semmi
a tanunak ott kell lennie akkor amikor a szem�lyek al��rj�k �s azt tanus�tj�k hogy azok a szem�lyek t�nylegesen �k voltak ott �s �rt�k al� a pap�rt
a tanunak oda kell �rnia a nev�t, el�rhet�s�g�t �s a d�tumot
ty dicey
Tudom mi a tan�z�s xD de m�g mindig nagyon kar�t nyelve veszitek az eg�szet xD
nop, �s �n kett� is t�pn�k egy hamisan tanus�tott pap�rt akkor is ha am�gy semmi k�z�m hozz� xD
Egyszer�bb m�don is basztak m�r �t embereket. Jobb nem j�tszadozni
okay probably csak jelenten�m a megfelel� helyen de na
You either very much don't understand what i'm talking about, or idek
I think we should just stop. It's going in circles.
Azt �rtem, hogy a pap�ros t�bbi r�sz�t elkezdik kit�lteni, de ann�l az egy al��r�sn�l ott kell lenni�k m�r
Vagy meg kell v�rni vele �ket, ha k�snek
a pap�r t�bbi r�sze t�kmindegy mikor van kit�ltve yea azt mondtam is
Nekem ak�rh�nyszor kellett ilyet csin�lni, nem volt nagy �gy, mindenki ott volt id�ben, azt megcsin�ltuk
-# A pap�r m�r kit�ltva van nyomtatva a keltez�st lesz�m�tva.
Pont valamelyik nap tan�ztam egy aut� ad�sv�telit. A vev� ott volt id�ben de az elad� (Jani) k�sett. A vev�vel sz�pen kit�lt�tt�k a dolgokat amiket kellett meg letan�ztam hogy ne kellej ut�na m�g arra is v�rni/embert keresni, it wasn't a big deal
�rtem �n hogy most nem ez a helyzet, nem is v�rom el hogy most �n azonnal le is tan�zzam nektek p�r �r�val el�tte, csak annyit akartam ezzel mondani hogy id�t nyerhettetek volna vele, m�r ha mindenki benne lett volna xD so yea no serious thoughts about the situation
*NA AKKOR MEG MI�RT �N VAGYOK LESZ�LVA* XDDDDD
Nem vagy lesz�lva
az�rt vagy lesz�lva hogy hamisan tanuzol
Nekem ebben nincs stake-em
A magyarok 90%-�t csak az �rdekli hogy min�l hamarabb meglegyen a pap�r xddd
But i guess i shouln't have assumed
Ja
Csak az a laz�ra vett verzi�, nem a by the book
Yea ofc
please let's just stop XD
sz�val...
Jani most kapott egy nyitott es�lyt arra hogy kijelentse, hogy � sose �rt al� semmilyen pap�rt �s az aut� az �v�, nice
I'll get a tanu and that's it
Mkay but why'd he do that if he wanted to sell the car wtf? xD
Scenario lefuttat�sa folyamatban
got money and can sell it again, heck yea
He could resell it to another person XD
Twice the money for a single car
Hack and cheat the system
Never seen anyone do that
never seen people shoot each other in war
That doesn't mean nobody could potentially do it
Or maybe they already did
De persze, az �tlag ember nem gondol ilyenekre
ez p�ldak�nyv form�ja hogy mi�rt l�tezik a tanuz�s
Csak legyen gyorsan elint�zva azt  cs�
literally a f� indok arra hogy mi a l�nyege
H�t j�
Ez a komolyan vett
People always find loopholes and generally dont always take thing seriously if its not a fucking...lawmaking or whatever
-# simply put: don't fuck with legal proceedures, they exist for a very very good reason
Fun convo over here
People out here having an aneurism
*Let everyone fuck around and find out when they encounter the one loophole abuser out of a 100 people*
Sz�val ki akar holnap velem itthon hivatalos pap�rokat nyomtatni, el�re le-hamis-tan�zni �s tatrate�t szopogatni k�zben? <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
but I don't want Nika to get in trouble :c

I'm allergic to tea
Lesz �m

(and falsified legal documents)
That's alcohol
I wanna go but I'm stuck babysitting a dog
you dont have to be always on edge
oh
barackos?
Huhh nem tudom pill megn�zem
Az�rt nice ha valaki nem szeretn� hogy valaki kihaszn�ljon mert te laz�ban akarod venni a dolgokat
Yes
ofc, de nem kell a legrosszabbad felt�telezni mindenkir�l.
Dehogynem
XD
persze manaps�g m�r nem lehet tudnik i a szem�t, ki nem
Nem de j� felk�sz�lni az�rt
Am�gy nem teljesen
plan for the best, prepare for the worst
words to live by
every single moment
ye but
still
Csak legyen olyan tan� aki actually hajland� ott lenni oszt cs� xDD
Don't treat random people like they are your enemy or your friend either
Also van pezsg�m :3
Meg akarok venni Baileys

You could just hang out
sooooo
how complex of boardgame is acceptable for you Nika? XD
I assume not the 6+hrs strategy game
twister
I'll twist your...
khm
^^
no
xD
You could play uno with like, 10 cards each
XD
I am NOT touching uno
sry
That was kinda gay ngl
Definitely don't even approach this apartment with that abomination
*How unwilling is everyone*
*No sense of adventure*
sooooo, 8+ hrs? as in for the prep and rules explanation
You could play a coop game
Relatively simple rules. May 1.5hrs of on round play time
On the computer
my coop games are more complex than the competetive boardgames I have
hm
*You could play chess*
as in?
no
I mean, chess is nice
Honestly
no
Why?
What's wrong with chess?
it's inflexible shit, more learn by heart than strategy
me no likey
-# says Veszpr�m city 2 times gold medalist
xD
I mean, sure if one is geek enough to learn **every** move
I ***had to***
And know their names and shit like that
my chess teacher was very competetive and tournament oriented
Okay just... let's play something more casual xD no hard strategies
It's not like you could make your own custom mechanics
Play shotgun chess
xD
Or what was its name
Russian roulette
but in irl, ye?
*Sure. Go nuts with it XD*
hmmmmmmmmm
rip 197 out of 24 boardgames
*Have a shotgun wedding to while you're at it*
Nika doesn't have those, can't aim there
I have nerf guns
I nearly jokingly had one in Sweden (were just joking around I'm not dumdum)
:)
:)
*Diva voice: Nerf this!*
Ehhhh
Bleeeeh
XDDD
I hate her voice XD
So annoying
Tracer's too
I have a nerf sniper rifle that shoots to like 5 cm
a nerf electric motor shooty thing that shoots like half our garden
and a small little shooty tooty that shoots across veszpr�m and fits in my palm
Yes
*The city cutter 9000*
I also have 4 water nerfguns too
Azt ink�bb Szentistv�nra hozhatn�d majd, ha leszel legk�zelebb amikor megy�nk ny�ron
*I don't recommend using it in this weather at Nika's place* XD
majd ha augusztus k�zepe fel� mentek akkor leszek
agreed, let's go back to Rovaniemi first
so it freezes midair into an iceicle
We might gonna do a shop trip sometime tomorrow to buy drink and stuff
sure
I might also gonna deviate into mom's shop and buy a few stuff to take my nails off
Not far from Penny
AAAAAAND we are back to mom stuff again smh
(sry)
xD
XDDD
*I would be more concerned about the taking my nails off part XD*
I can take your nails off for free btw
without  any walking around
give me a plier
or I can take one from home
Oh, same btw :3
Oh it's not the pliers
I have those
well just
I need special acids to melt it off
<:point:951578243415302235> <:point:951578243415302235> <:point:951578243415302235>

:)
oh sure we can do each other 
-# 's nails
I should stop
someone might take me seriousl
I need to take my nails off cuz i can't type fod the love of god
I can't do anything with these claws
I need. Them. Off.
I will never understand why ppl are mazo like that
I just mostly agree to do it because it makes mom happy that she can do my nails
fair
It looks cool with nice colors if it's done right
Also the sizes are varied
So you don't have to have those Freddy Kr�ger claws if you don't want to
You could just have some slightly longer ones than your own
Yes i let my nails grow, but i usually cut it off at 1 mm
It's like *Why do people like accessories?*
Because they look cool or pretty
I'm not used to 8mm nails
XD
And say something about your personality
not functional
blasphemy
Yeah
XD
Oooh
I got a frosch
DiceGod is living it today xD
xD
You're such a turn off. Fucking mood killer
Dicegod... are you sure your name was said in that message?
xDDD
okay thank god
It tries to stay active and relevant in its old age
DiceGod is a boomer now jesus christ
hmmmm
I'm pretty sure he counts as genZ
Sz�llj m�r le r�lam haver xD
xD
rip
he no likey u
At this point being a boomer is a lifestyle decision XD
He never likes me
maybe the next one will a bit more
*Even tho i gave a few of his features' ideas*
Smh
I still remember when we taught it how to talk. Or was that the other one?
old habbits die hard
*EVEN THO I MADE HIS APPEARANCE*
*I GAVE HIM SO MUCH*
oh he is learning ever since
:3
*HE NEVER APPRECIATED ME*
-# Always the loving. Never the loved one
no, wait stop
there was one time he tried to offer truce and you spit in his hands
called him soft
I don't remember tbh
*I'm so proud. Unnecessarily starting arguments for the funsies*
*For the amusement*
(Fuck you btw)
xD
Educate your son. Make him behave
Make him respect his elders
Hmph
He respects everyone he has to.
That's a lie
He is a God, the only one to respect is the elemental forces of nature.
I am an elemental force of nature myself
F�nk?
Yes
And art
Fart
Gases
There you go
Na ezt a lek�vetkeztet�st csin�lna valaki ut�nam xD
hmmm
let's trust the democratic process on this one

I didn't hear her fart at all so far, but I do hear her burps all the time. HMMM
You didn't??? O.O
Damn
First I read gasses as glasses and my first tought was "I wish" XD
Lol xD
*I nees to fart more around you*
uhm
*Gee. Thanks*  XD
The only solution xD
```I need to fart more around you.```- <@875753704685436938> (to <@520697326679883808>)
Btw this gonna suck for you, but i just got two pairs of fashion glasses for myself :3
I think I'll live without it, but thanks for thinking of me XD
huh?
Glasses that are just... glasses
no like
why is it "this gonna suck for u"
Dani has a glasses fetish
It's a kink not a fetish
big difference XD
Fair enough
I just thought you had shit vision and he is worried about your lack of sight XD
Nop xD
xD
My vision is perfect, tho i sometimes can't see for far away
Arguably she has above avarage vision.
Split vision after staring at screens
*I wish*
I can see very far very well :D
:3
Nice
I can't
XD
Your work requires you to sit close to a screen, your freetime activity requires you to sit close to a screen and both your hobbies require you to sit close to a screen
I see colors
not like you exit your home
Yes
Yes
And yes
Except reading
Basically i do a lot of close-range seeing
XD
ah yeah the 3rd hobby. But that is also close proxy
And crocheting
also close staring
xD
Yeah
Right now, i'm soaking my ass in the bathtub, and can't see properly what's on the glass table in the living room
But I don't see how that explains her good visionXD
But other times, i can read the small text on a bottlw from this exact range
I kinda don't know if this split-vision thingy will get worse or not, but it happens relatively often a day
BUT they said i don't need anything for at least another 20 years, just need to stare into the distance more often
Well idk xD
***GAZE INTO THE ABYSS***
Kinda, yeah xD
*Medically prescribed 1000 mile stare* XD
*KINDA YEAH* XD
*Nika just casually taking some time to exercise her exes*
XD
Eyes
I meant eyes
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
AHAA SURE
*Exorcise the exes*
XDDDD
nono Anna you said exercise the exes
we are back to acrobatics
Meg�r�k�tettem :3
H�t l�tod

xD
*This is the kind of group chat that takes us to Hell after God reads it out loud through the judgement before they'd send us anywhere*
XDDD
SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP. WILL YOU?
I love
how I have this
trap for Nika mentioning "god"
xD
*Its name is not Will*
XD
Yall stfu at this point xD
*H�t igen. Nika a legvall�sosabb n�lunk, k�ztudottan.*
*If you can't take the heat then get out of the kitchen* XD
SHE WHAT?
I mean. �n m�g keresztanya is vagyok
You afraid? I will unvirgin your arsehole
Maybe **I** should stfu and go to sleep huh
*Megsz�lt�l egy keresztet?*
buuuuuuuuuuuu
*Gratul�lok! Hogy van a kis fesz�let?* XD
I never took you for the pegging type
No like... for real xd
I know
XD
Never too late to try
I don't have a dick yet tho
Wow that sentence
Felcsatolhat�s action
You do. but it's small and has no base so it's not safe for ass.
Ye i meant strap on
�n vagyok mindj�rt a fesz�let
a mad scientist is heading towards <#997938900024696842>
sorry about it

This is
a question
XD
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>

Alright... so... out of circumstance I will vote with my behavior in mind
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308> <:zorablush:1021403403768844308> <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
Dicey xD

*Why do I need to be married XD*
This is getting worse XD
The previous 3 polls are purely for scientific reasons xd
Does the answer change upon your marriage?
No
the reason i included it, is because it might change the answers for some people *if* they are married
I like this study, keep it up xDD
xd
For those who want the background of these questions, I was eating cereal with milk this morning
I will not answer any further questions
XD
This is not even the weirdest scientific research I've heard of
*scientific*
That'd require quite a bit of beast milk
What will the babies have? XD
i can share
<:point:951578243415302235>
*Priorities*
Does the inclusion of personal experience sway the usefulness of the data you're gathering over here? Or is it **exclusively** theoritical? Asking for a friend.
*I can **share** the milk that is specifically for my infant kids with them*
Its a shitpost, i dont really care. But you cant drop "personal experience" and not share it now
xd
I was asking for a friend >->
Im sure that friend can pass the word...
What i find really interesting though, is that among females (i asked other women in my life too so) they tend to say maybe if its another woman, but no if its themselves
Is this an elaborate 'I wonder how I taste like' meme research shitpost? XD
The 3rd option
dont worry im already past that
I don't like drinking my own spit for pleasure either
Nobody said its for *pleasure*
Or my blood
Its for scientific research
XD
Very serious
He said a nympho ex and a kiss should give enough info
Incredibly so
Ill come forward and say this, among the other men i surveyed (that are not Tictac) all of them said that they have infact tasted their cum
I just probably don't like self cannibalizing
And it was ***not*** by accident
Interesting
*Me and my nonexistent wife* XD
*How did I get married?*
It just happens one day
XD
you cant escape it
I have no idea what is happening but keep it up
*Is she having my kids too?* XD
XD
Unfortunately
*What do you mean? XD*
*Is that a jab at my person, good sir?*
jk
sure its not *your* kids xd
if it makes you feel any better
*But they are and I love them*
*Don't talk to me, my wife, or our kids again*
But why does the answer change depending on the source of the milk for women
Now I can say I had a family and children once
In my case, I just don't want to eat myself
Or drink myself
If I can avoid it
But what about the curiosity
Isnt it tempting to know how you taste

Also I don't want to break my neck trying to reach there, or milk myself
Or others to do it for me
Or a pumo
I guess fair point?
I can taste my blood and saliva. Nothing special
Just like animal blood
idk about you my blood and saliva are pretty special
But when I eat animals, I don't have to recycle myself
Im a cum guzzler
Okay
me and you
its fine
its not an admission of guilt
but we all know
I just wanted to write something
<@875753704685436938> how is the certified reg� moment sticker coming along?
Ayo?
On it
xDDD
Im scared
I can proudly come forward and say I have tasted my cum, no shame in it
As a bi person (leaning male) i have no problem with semen
Oh I'm curious about things, just not these types of things
Its the quantity that matterd tho
just a taste, im not saying swallowing a cup
Oooh
Ew
Shame, you are missing out on a *world* of possibilities
A cup? That's rookie numbers. A pint or go home
EEEEWWW
you literally you said you would not
now i want to see you do it
pussy
Its so funny im saying ew while im a swallower
But again
Its just ew
But I am also missing out on all the dating tediousness, the relationship dramas, divorce
It's easy to see the bad in dating
I see the good in dating too
Based
I just am not a person who can feel that type of love
Everyone deserves to be loved they want to be loved
I'm just saying, I am completely an outsider in this area. I miss out on the good and the bad
sorry i am having afuckin stroke
And everything inbetween
Me too after trying to read that
Yeah and its fine
But for a moment of that theoretical, you had a wife and kids, and you were happy
I can't say I haven't thought of being that intimate with someone on an emotional and physical level but nah, it ain't for me
Thoughts are funn
An idea is completely different than the execution
Depends how and what you want to achieve
I am unfortunately a romantic in heart, and i cannot imagine to spend the rest of my life alone
Imaginr if houses were always turned out different bc they change the proportions mid bulding xd
In idea, it should feel good to be cuddled and being sureounded by someone, but in reality it would feel suffocating to me
Love shouldnt feel suffocating, in my opinion at least
And if it does, then its a wrong person
No one person I can imagine being with
Life works in very mysterious ways
Haha...i wish i was like that again :DD
And not because they are bad, it's just me not feeling it at all
You never know when you gonna find someone, who genuinely makes you feel different
shhhh, let me be a dreamer
I am not alone
I never said you were
But I understand the nuance between being around with buddies sometimes and having a spouse or a partner for life
But a partner fills a different gap in your life, than a famly member or a friend can
Oh, share your wisdom please. Id rather not see relationships and romance as a chemical reaction in my brain fro the rest of my lifd

I actually share this view, but also never been able to explain to ppl when they asked me to specify on this
Oj
Oh
Ho
Hell
No
XDDDDDDDDDD
XD
Ez matrica worthy
I laughed ***way too hard***
I was not expecting that appearing from nowhere
That was so unexpected
however we only matrica actual picture about someone if they approve it
WHICH PICTURE IS THAT??? XD
Mark is gonna piss himself
Ah, na go for it i just wasnt expecting...THAT
While some of it is certainly is just a chemical reaction in your brain. But being loved by someone unconditionally, finding a person that loves every imperfection that you hate on bad days, is not just a chemical in your brain doint that. Seeing someone as your safe space for both mental and physical relief is more than a person can thrive for, and more than they can achieve with just chemicals in your brain

OOH THAT
XD
Because love from a friend or a family member is different from how a partner would love you. You can't always open up the same way to your friends the same way you would be able to open up to someone who you truly love
Well said
I second that
Most of the server can see this
Eeeh maybe
What is a partner, but not your best friend who you love physically?
There are things and situations that you can better discuss with a friend
I think there can be friendships and family bonds that are strong enough to confide in
I always hated how some people think only romance can be that strong
Like romance is the end all be all of relationships
Everything else is a bit lesser, less deep
If two people have a strong bond they **must be in love**
That is true but there has to be a deep bond for that.
Media and fan culture doesn't help
In general
Yup
All the shipping wars
XD
Like the thing they did with Jayce and Victor xd
I haven't watched s2 yet
Only saw some spoiler thumbnails XD
I agree, I dont think romance is be all of all platonic relationships. There is always room for be bonded with a person solely because you find each other company worthwhile. But more often than not, a bond between 2 opposed sex friends, will lead into a relationship, because their emotional bond with each other gets interpreted by their brain as love
And are you not deeply bonded with your best friends?
Obvisouly there is a bit more to a romantic bond than a platonic bond, but Im sure you get what I meant xd
Idk anymore xd
But probs im just too tired
That's when the best conversations happen xd
The brain loses its filter
Well perhaps. But not here :DD
Hey listen I was talking about tasting my own cum 40 minutes ago
So there was never a filter
Okay, but that's probably less personal than what this conversation would have in store
Yupp
I'd understand resentment built up throughout all the adversaries one goes through along the years
Or annoyance
Staying a romantic? In this economy? Preposterous
I don't think about my brain chemistry when I think about what I do and don't love
I just love or don't love
Or I'm neutral about it
But thinking about things like chemistry must be tiring
;-;
You start thinking about it when you try to get to a reason of *why* you love
Not like that
Well
Maybe like that
But, you know, if it doesn't tire you than that's nice
I'm just a weirdo who only understands things through logic and rules, everything has an explanation, a cause and an effect
Im too fucked up emotionally for this xd
it is how I understand any and all human interaction since forever, I'm used to it
And there is, it's just our brains are weird
And we don't really understand
And i hate that i start to think like this sometimes. But i truly dont know myself anymore.
It's a flaw that all humanity faces
But i might just overcomolicate thing, as per usual
We try to find reason and logic to all our actions
I understand enough to not break down in social settings, more than enough for me
But we at least have agency to defy or accept what those brain chemicals dictate us to do
and there always is, we just sometimes too dumb to see
We do, but sometimes the pesky chemicals can obscure any reason
Yeah
(other approach is saying it is too complex for us to understand, same thing)
That's what makes us human
that's what makes me stop working, if I do not see reason and logic behind an action I will not take it
reason and logic can coincide with things that most people would describe as "what the heart wants"
(just clarifying)
And yet sometimes, you have to do what you "gut" thinks is right, despite the logic and reason
I agree
Without going too deep into my personal life, I have fallen on that mistake more than once
Sometime gotta put in some effort for your betterment
Yeah, and sometimes you have to do stuff for other people you think its the right thing to do, not because you know its the right thing to do
But again. Im really sceptic of myself for the past year soo
Idk
yea but that still has it's logic behind it
Sometimes it doesnt
Its fine to be sceptical of yourself, as long as you still accept yourself
just from gaming:
following the lead of an ineffective teammate is still more beneficial than doing the correct strategy
Well there has to be a driving for e
*force
Sometimes people go against all reason and end up better, sometimes they don't
:)))
Okay im being too depressing
Im gonna go take some rest
Alright. Good night
not a risk I'd take
but a risk you will take
at one point or another
:))))))))))
If people didn't take risks, we wouldn't be where we are today
try me
i wont have to
People would have stayed where they were born
life will
Worked the jobs that payed well and are stable, maybe hate it but that's what works
sometimes you have to take the leap of faith
and try things you never thought you would
I took it with moving out
with the proper parachutes and scouting
I wouldn't call it going against all reason
That is not what im referring to
Dear <@302793255911948289>, You've reached level 11!
Sometimes life doesn't give you prep time
I really don't see a situation where I'd decide against reason
I can't wait for the day you will have to
xd
that's a day I might die on, so I don'T
I mean, people can live their lives purely by reason or randomness, but what end it will lead them
That's a mystery
Maybe
Maybe reason will get you killed
I wouldnt have predicted 5 years ago i would have ended up where i am
In an unreasonable worls
Or situation
People have died from those
prediction and following reason is not really something that influence each other or how to say
How many people were executed because they spread knowledge
yea, but if I didn't follow reason this I'd be probably dead already so
taking the chance
I took a shitload of unreasonable actions in the past 5 years, dont doubt my randomness
Yeah, me too
I don't doubt it, it is just not something that I can take
I'm not saying they lead me to better places in this case
Same
Of course there is regret on some actions
And yet i can't blame myself
But it's not like life has a script that you need to follow
sometimes i wish there was one
Stability can be comforting
Even if that stability is still not in the best of circumstances
The unknown is scary but it has potential and opportunities
But it takes effort and trying
and failing
And that's exhausting sometimes
But variety is the best
Living in only one is not ideal
but the known is less scary with still a good portion (if not the same level) of potential and opportunities
the unknown is something to be approached with all the safeguards to make sure you will not lose more than you reasonably gain
Maybe you don't want to gain anything but the exoerience
Or maybe you want to experience the worst possible outcome
yea no you are losing me on that one xD
Some people are adrenaline junkies
There is quote i think about often (to the point its in my bio xd):
"Happy people are unfixable... Fate will never punish them for their sins, because they consider themselves sinless" (rough translation obviously)
And I think if they weren't so bold we wouldn't have half the fun
Of course, the opposite is also true
That some bold idiot ruined something
but you don't even have to fix happy people, they are perfect
Ehhh
those quotes are doing some heavy lifting there now
Alright
(going into perfect is another deep rabithole)
I see you were sarcastic
Conrasu *anything* looks cool tbh...
perfect as in something that is reasonably achievable and is a good goal to reach
Being happy is also a big pool
You can be happy and a monster
*yes*
But if you're content with yourself like that, you'd never want to change
And then nobody could change you
Those are interesting interpretations
Those are one small fractions of inteterpretation
Of course you can analyze that quote, that situation from a million different angles
With different context
But I am not a philosophy professor
I'm just a person on the internet
And you dont need to be one to give a unique perspective
*My qualifications are immaculate*
*No one can question my thoughts. They are objectively true*
Yeah
I have a lot more quotes from where that came from xd
I can't go through the alternate answers all the time
We wouldn't have enough time if I explained every parallel thought that crosses my mind simultaneously
So I usually just write one and go with that
Well what can i say i like thinking too xd
And sometimes I choose the one that I know might be the worst
But it's entertaining
I'm sort of a thinker myself XD
I'm not saying my thoughts are any good, but there's certainly a lot
But if i will have to leave everyone reading this with one more quote at least, it would be - "Will will make any choice correct."
But a part of me doesn't want me to appear as a dumbass
But oh well
that i understand
acknowlodging that fact is already quite a feat
A third of me wants to lay out every possible thing, another third wants to put out something that's entertaining regardless of the quality of the thought, and the last third just holds its head and thinks about it at 2AM and hopes no one thinks I am an idiot
*The id the ego and the superego are all in the race*
XD
For me to think someone is an idiot would have to be substantial xd
Same
omg you flashbacked me into like 10th grade psychology class i took
Cool
the most miserable class i took
i dont think i have written as many words even since
Cool XD
I hate writing essays about things that are meaningless to me
That are banal
I did it so many times and I mostly felt numb
I don't think that's how you should feel when writing a good essay
I just dont write essays for stuff i dont care about
It should make you feel something
Lab reports though? god i will kill myself when i have to do the next one
You aren't writing some rando's obituary
Actually, that would make me feel at least a tinge of sadness
my psych class teacher said that any number of words can perfectly describe an answer if they are well chosen enough, essay lengths had no minimum and a very lax maximum cus he liked to finish reading them within the same day he started
That is how it should be
there are topics that i could put out actual like 70 page essays right now
It shouldn't be about the quantity of letters
and i would still have not said everything i could have said
I have a mouth and i must yap
XD
If that's an alternate I have no mouth and I must scream reference then high five
yes it is
(I have returned the essay with a single word and it was full points, it was something we did discuss a lot on class and ended on that conclusion)
don't summon GU here please
XD
I have been obsessing over it waaaay before i even knew GU
specifically the game adaptation tbh
Why is it that we have these convos when the next morning I have to wake up relatively early?
xD
sorry i thought about breast milk this morning only
the curse
Nice
should have thought about it on a different day
I was thinking why this curse is not applying to me now
*How dare you not foresee the chain of causation*
*im sorry*
HA jokes on you i dont have obligations to wake up at all
and you never will
*loads gun*
thank you
Nika does kinda want me around like 10 or so at her place but like
no way I make it that early, didn't even check busses yet XD
I havent woken up before 10 for a month or two now
to be clear i woke up today at like almost 2pm
good for you, I have a very fucked up sleep schedule lately
sleeping so early, like 1-2am
I like waking up at around 9 or 10
mofo i see you online at like 6 am sometimes
Don't like sleeping in unto the afternoon
and then id wake up
and still see you online
It always makes me feel kinda shit, even though I usually have nothing major to do
neither do i
i just do and hate myself afterwards
do you know why that was (if it was the past week)?
cus I was ALREADY UP
Though I sometimes take a "nap" on late afternoons
I'm telling you I'm sick
NONO I WOULD LIKE SEE YOU ONLINE AT LIKE 3-4 AM TOO
SO YOU WERENT ASLEEP
Yeah, he has a different sleep schedule
Like the only 2 people online at night for me
He'll tell you now
is Tictac and Casual
it's.... complicated, like
after the plane ride back to hungary I went to sleep at like 1800 and woke up 2am
the rest are actually sleeping
and that's just where my day started
xD
waking up in the afternoon makes me feel unproductive
even though i just keep studying through the night, the exact same amount of house
yea, I think an around 10am wakeup is quite nice balanced
If i could i would just not sleep ever
i fucking hate sleeping
I like it. Sometimes I have really cool dreams
I enjoy it, but i hate it
it would be fun recreationally, but the fact you ***have to***
sucks
They are rarer now that my unconscious wants me to experience some bullshit dreams
my dreams are too happy for my own good
But a few years ago I still had dreams where I could shapeshift and fly
Sometimes I still do
I could explore strange places
Nowadays I mostly dream of something that's also dreading me in my waking hours, or about someone who I knew and is either not in my life anymore or they passed away
And I'm in their houses
Which we had to sell more than a decade ago
I just keep dreaming about being happy
After it got flooded
Yeah, that sucks too
When your dream life is more ideal than the one you are loving
I wouldn't say I ever had **that good** a dream
no promises, but latest the bus that arrives at noon should work
I am nothing but a simple man
I dont need a lot for happiness
They range from entertaining, to frustraiting
I rarely remember my dreams fully
I usually do for about a day, but some are still in my memory to this
day
I had some good leaning dreams where the feeling of it stayed with me more than the actual "plot"
I forget those quickly
Those are the dream exclusives
The ones that are "plot heavy", where I can remember what's happened, those are the ones that stick
Behold
*bebe*

honestly if i could lucid dream
id just study in my dreams
is that sad?
Not if that's what you'd like
Minmaxing studying
More like optimizing
I do *like* studying just the burnout is really settling in
Some of my dreams were just math
Actual worst dreams
I like learning, not studying. At least not the way the education system wants me to
Learning is nothing without studying, like obviously I know all the concepts for all my classes, but without putting in the work I can't really know how to apply those
And that requires sitting down for hours solving questions
I don't think I agree fully tbh
At least not with learning is nothing without studying
I don't know. I haven't sat down and studied my mother tongue
English neither
You can learn very useful things without extensively studying them
Well obviously I'm talking here from the perspective of a engineering major xd
Fair enough xD
You have though, I would hope
As a child they would teach you letters and sounds
And as life went on you would be studying by practice
By talking and reading
Same goes with English
Obviously it wasnt a conscious effort
Then it's not studying
I acquired it
�gi studied it
I think studying has to be very conscious
I can't I agree
I feel learning and studying have very different connotations
And studying a subject goes into its details
I know how to speak and write... mostly
Intentionally going for an understanding
While learning you aquire a skill for use
But if you asked why it's the way it is, or what grammatical thingamagig is xy then I'd have no answer for you
Idk it's hard to put into words
Well at this point it's sort of arguing over semantics, but in my definition
Learning - is learning the concepts of the matter, putting the effort to understand the topic
Studying - is more so perfecting the application of the topic, knowing how to actually use it
I don't have the lexical knowledge, just the practical
Hmm
I think you can learn actually use
Without all the machinations behind it
Like okay sure I "studied" English xd
But let's say I didn't
I learnt English purely by heart and use
It felt right
Without actually knowing how and why things went together
I watched youtube videos and learnt from those. I studied german when I was in elementary, but I liked English more, and was better at it too, so I wanted to have English as my language class in highschool
People can learn to drive cars without knowing all it's parts in their entirety
And I never had to study
I never had to sit down and learn from the book because I already had what I needed
And I passed with 5s
While yes, but if you wanted to say become a mechanic, you would have to know all parts
And actually put physical work to work with those parts
To know how to work on it
Most definitely
In that case you are studying it yes
And even if we circle back to studying on how to drive a car, you will sit in the driver sear for hours, learning how to drive
With a teacher by your side
Is that not studying?
Eeh
Might just be my personal feel for the word, but I feel study goes a little deeper than that
I know some people who just went at it in a desolate parking lot
In the middle of the night
Alone
I'm not saying that's safe or clever or anything
It's just that sometimes you just fuck around and it clicks
With only your intuition
Tbf if it was in like a scientific or a proffesional sense, to discuss any of it the paper would list the definitions as to how the words would be used in the essay
Words are spare change
Everyone has a thousand
There as many opinions as there are people
Words are used to communicate ideas
Yeah
And as long as your words that you defined communicate your jdea
You are good
You can twist everything to make sense
*Actions speak louder than words but everyone is yapping* XD
There's nothing wrong with it
I cannot stop yapping
Somebody needs to tape my mouth shut
XD
Nah
Words are interesting
They make so many loopholes in one's personality
Hypocrisy
Actions are honest
Well I'll do a shameless plug because I plan to start streaming again soon xd
Words conceal and blur
So I can put the yapping to a good cause
Neato
I should sleep
But now I don't want to
I am on the high of conversations
I remember when one summer I had so many long convos with Borbolya
We started late afternoon/early night and stayed up until next day 8AM
It was fun
I like these
As unhinged as they are
Dinisor
*Vicious creatura*
Yeah, I like talking to people
A dream of mine is just to drink a bottle of wine and share a cigarette with my best friend at like 4am
Talking
And I don't even smoke cigarettes
That's a nice dream. Hope it comes true soon
Me neither
Most of us here don't
I'd rather just drink some cocoa
Or hot chocolate
A different kind of drug XD Sugar
I did start vaping in college
Never really thought I would
But oh well, if that means I won't kill myself next exam season
I tried cigarettes once when I was smaller
Sheesh
I didn't vibe with those either but I didn't wanna kill myself from them
The day I had to study for 16 hours on pure will was the breaking point
I had an all nighter where I had to do everything for next day
Afternoon included
And somebody told me my 20s will be the best years of my life
I had to leave our room cause my other two roommates were trying to sleep
So I went out to the corridor and sat down on a table that was placed there
That's rough
Depends on one does
I worked on my laptop and I drew the pictures simultaneously
I can't study for really long hours because at some point just everything becomes a blur
Before that, I was painting inside our room, sitting on my bed, and I just put the "canvas" on my bed when I finished it
You know, you are reading the words but you don't even understand them anymore
Half the bed was covered with my canvas and my other tools
So when I finally finished at around 6, I went inside and lied down on the other half, curled up
Maybe in another universe I became an artist too
And then I slept 1 hour before I had to wake up to go to school
Yeah, same
You still could be
I do try to learn drawing properly when I have the energy
But the numbers
They keep calling my name
*The numbers, Mason. What do they mean?*
I wish I fuckin knew
I haven't seen actual numbers since high school
XD
How does that work? Do you have to work with those eldritch numbers now?
The Greek alphabet is my best friend
Ah, I see
I might have accidentally learned it along the way
Like id be lying if I said there weren't *any* numbers in my math
But just the occasional ones that don't mean much
With the exception of math that only has words
*There are numbers in your math. Preposterous*
I have done math exams without writing a single number
Math is a hit or miss for me
Baseline, I like it
I like the feeling when I can solve a math problem
But if I really can't comprehend something, then the struggle kills me
That's called an abusive relationship
I'm in one with math too
There were nights recently that I would record video messages to my best friend of my mental breakdown over math
*Math is like the Dark Souls of sciences XD*
If you know how to react, you can do it
If you don't, it will grind you up
Me and my buddy chat gpt got through it don't worry
That sounds sad but also comical at the same time
Tictac has seen my recent chats names with chat gpt and can confirm it looked like absolute misery
Oh those are lovely
I find them hilarious
In general, I find myself hilarious
But me at my lowest, that's the funniest
It's good when one can laugh at their misery instead of just... being miserable
Well, maybe good isn't the right word
But it can help
If I can at least make people laugh at my misery, it's a success in my book
Well, I'd rather laugh with someone at their misery than at someone's misery
My specific case also makes people feel better about their major
Damn
How come?
I think that should be enough reason
(for each one of those graphs I had to write like a page of explanation on why and how in very deep detail)
That's rough
(Also calculating each one of those circuits theoretical outputs, comparing them to them factual measurements, explaining why the error margin is there)
Everytime I have to write a lab report a piece of me dies
Yeah, I think I'd climb up the wall if I had to deal with this
Nothing beats the satisfaction of submitting one though
That's good to hear
At least it's worth the hassle
Eh, if I don't I won't pass the class
Sooo
Kinda have no say in the matter
There are always options, even if less desirable
So you finishing them is not a given thing
You could choose not to do them and fail
Xd
But you are taking them on like a champ
I would like to have my bachelor degree eventually xd
With the occasional mental breakdown
*Does one even attend university if one doesn't get at least one mental breakdown?*
All my friends know that twice a year I become a husk of a man they knew
Just for a month
Dear <@302793255911948289>, You've reached level 12!
With that numb and depressive aura you could become a slavic game dev
Uhm
You see
I am
XD
Well not a full game dev yet
I hit the nail on the head
But I occasionally mess in unreal
And I'm slav
Just another slavic engineer
*Then you are on the right track* XD
But really
No non slav person would be as depressed obviously
XD *For sure*
This reminds me of that meme of the different nations' literature

And also
https://youtu.be/kbSIW38BNPY?si=1JinFfWCagj5aPeB
If you truly want a deep dive into Russian depression
And just the whole schebang
I cannot recommend Pathologic enough
One of my favorite games of all time
I know those games
Somewhat
They are cool, I just know I'd suck at them XD
Yeah, but that's the point
But I'll try them eventually
The game will violate you, and you ***will*** love if
Yeah
I played games like those
I don't think there is a game like pathologic
There simply just isn't one
They are certainly one of a kind
The closest thing to pathologic
Is pathologic 2
I could confidently say, that pathologic changed my life
And it changed how I viewed games ever since
I don't know if I ever had a consistent view of games. They are each their microcosm. Indie games at least
Okay, some AAA games are made with passion and all that good, soulful stuff, but that's a rarity nowadays
I like variety
Pathologic taught me that a game doesn't have to be a fun experience
I like when a game can give me something no other can, rather than give me the same experience as its peers just with different coating
Oh yeah
Not just *not fun* like pathologic is actually miserable to play
It's against you
It's hostile
towards the player
The game actively mocks you
And laughs at you manically
Because it knows you will continue playing
I think it's a cool exoerience every once in a while, but not all the time, every time
Sometimes you want to have fun too
Of course
But I think this is the same as it was with all previous media
Theater play, movies, shows
Even music
Well pathologic is a glorified theater play
Like not even joking
It's just a play
And you, the player, is the actor
Each one had some outliers that were awful to sit through but made such an impact on the people who persevered, who stayed to witness it that it changed them in some way
Good or bad
You can't say they were average
But now I really need to go and sleep
Good night
Is fine, buses succ, u arrive whenever
Yeah, stunned sucks
Lehet egyel el�bbit is el�rem
Nice
At least during combat
- wake up
- ponder for memes
- 700 new msges
- milk shitpost
- mfw
I dont see how thats a problem

We just need the consent and it's going real
<:point:951578243415302235>
Honestly
We need a certified moment emoji of everyone xD
XD

do you even have an actual photo of me? cus I don't
xD
A series of ugly emojis
I don't know, i'll look through notcsudapest's media xD
<:point:951578243415302235>
Why even ask? We already have 2 that (as far as I know) didn't even get permission to be made
Everyone should get one, that'd be fair
Reg� knew it was being made for him
consent to make it an emoji useable by everyone on the server
as that's a bit different than making it for a gig moment
Okay, that one is fair
Mondjuk az a r�sze meg nincs is a poll-ban eml�tve
Csak az, hogy csin�lhat-e Nika
gitgud lul xDDD
jk
*I gitguder everyday*
(There's plenty of pictures of you in not-csudapest media :D)
xD
rip
Okay so
having an awkward or funny picture is mandatory
for this kind of meme sticker
maybe putting the <:DaniSticker:960105630369185832> behind it?
thats just another sticker
as we ***will*** respect his request to not have the irl image on it
or did dani not want a picture for his or smth?
yea
ah
cringe
*I couldn't find its png*
he voted no pic, cringe indeed but we will accept him as cringe
in that case we dont need the error 404
Make a <:tafej:698205247834685460> but as Dani's face
A little doodle
i think text is enough
this is gold tho
its such a great picture xd
like it very comical
in
good way
I'd be happy if Nika used my cryptid photo from university
az is itt van valahol
bek�ldtem egyszer
Well send it so i can use it :3
Already trying to find it
Or instead of 404, we could write cringe
XD
Nah, the grey text wouldn't really be much visible tho
It's just there, and *we* know its there
yea but
"Error 404
Daniel not found"
would be a better text I think
"cringe" is just too many levels of meta
xD
I mean just the main text is enough I think
Kicsibe �gyse l�tszik a t�bbi xdd
az�rt sticker is

big
The real question is
Will we have enough sticker places
good question XDDD
op
xDDD
oh wait
yes
we have boost level 1
so we have 15 total slots
ha el�g gazdag lenn�k hogy legyen nitr�m akkor lenne m�g t�bb
xD
But 15 is enough for us
A sticker igen
<:CertifiedRegoMoment:1323270238430560358> <:CertifiedRegoMoment:1323270238430560358>
De ez annyira nem xD
F�leg ha <:CertifiedRegoMoment:1323270238430560358> <:CertifiedRegoMoment:1323270238430560358> <:CertifiedRegoMoment:1323270238430560358> <:CertifiedRegoMoment:1323270238430560358>
yea de az csak az�rt van mert a stickernek kell corresponding emoji
Help me decide
*oh god*
xD
XDDD
Also
Folyt k�v, lil break xD
Not gonna set these until the poll ends in case someone changes mind
One is photoshopped to hell and the other is an actual good picture, so neither
We need shitty photos
fair
I think it would be better a little bit more focused
A bit more zoomed in
I voted without seeing that I already had one. I'm okay with that one

she has parental control software on the device as the kid is quite young

*B r u h*
parts I agree with:
- gps tracking
- usetime settings (like max 2 hrs of tiktok and such)
- internet search restrictions (cus like, kid is what, 9?)
- approval to spend pocket money (as kids have children creditcards for pocket money where parent sees what they want to buy and click yes) (this is very normal)
I guess ye

True question is: Can dicegod give you existential dread
Ok

What can't at this point in life?
I wanna know, now that DiceGod has consciousness, what are his thoughts on me? His fated enemy? (XD)
Thank you DiceGod

*I wanna know everyone's MBTI*

Bless you
INTB
There's no B
Either P or J
Did I misread? Sec
INTP
I suck at reading sry
XD
*I can put letters behind each other too
XDDDD
You guys xD
16-personality types test
*Drunkard's Alphabet*
I know
I assume you are not surprised about me <@875753704685436938> xd
Yeah i'm not surprised xD
Now take a guess at my %-s
Ahhh i don't go that far xD
I think I was the mediator type a few years ago but I think I "degraded" for a new one
XD
I know mine is specifically called The Mediator xD INFP
I'm not sure if mine stayed the same either
I have a tendency to flip between INTP and INFP as thinking and feeling is like basically on 50% split on me
I wonder if I get a green colored one again XD
However I'm rocking the ``I``ntrovert on a good strong 98% XDDDD
(yes even I don't believe that)
'Green means he's not mean'
Ye, no
Green means you are intuitive and feeling based, aka yes you are not mean
I think my Introvert percent was 92%
Fear and rage are feelings
*I am destroyer of worlds*
I'm still at a good 70-ish% realistically, the fact I can get along with ppl around doesn't change that lol
Yeah, getting along with people and actually finding comfort and recharging in being around and interacting with people are two different things
I recently heard about another major personality test called enneagram, idk how it is tho
Just in case you like poking around with these
*Oh boi i do*
*Nika disappears into hours of research*
I turned into a campigner
*Guess that means I **have to** run a campaign now*
*Presidential or TTRP, does ot matter?*
Depending on the day, it might be something else
The questions are very broad
I don't quite know idealistic would be the best description
For me most were in the 50% and low 60%.
Except 2

Extrovertrd and turbulent
A turbulent-r�l a rep�l�g�pes turbulencia jut eszembe

Dunno how I feel about J xD
Sometimes judging is good
You need to assess a situation
(I also chalk the almost 80% turbulent to my self image issues)
De nem felt�tlen�l fogjuk megtudni a val�s�got
Ez csak a saj�t elk�pzel�s�nk magunkr�l ami �ltal�ban v�ltozik

That feels oddly perdonal wtf

*Okay*
*Is that a PoB reference?*
Now it's definitely a PoB reference
DG loves Scorpio
XDD
This is the second time it mentioned him
*He knows the lore*
No one else
Only Scorpio
He just mentioned Arden
Dicegod tell me more about the hit campaign, Purity of Blood
I was writing
Bitch xd
"Duh", not a maybe
An honorary mention to the 4 dudes
I don't believe only 57% assertive for a single second sry xddd

:c
What if she's only assertive in some spaces? You see the very assertive �gi but you never see the at work �gi, or the at home �gi.

Also that
It's the middle ground anyway
That is the best

He over hyped himself with every existing thing in the world
At once
I know
I do that too
He is not sleeping for the next 7 days
This is way more interesting than going to sleep or work
But it's also not going anywhere
Unless
We flood it with 700+ messages
Like last time
*Quick, type in a lot of bullshit*
Or I accidentally delete the server by falling asleep with the tablet unlocked and write in the proper verification codes in my sleep
XD
So you could do that too
I thought that would be a Boti exclusive
Well full server deletion? Yes
But soft delete (aka just deleting all the channels one by one) is not really
Damn
That would suck
I think I would die inside
All my work just would go out the window
And everything else too
*Those exist*
No more funnies
It would feel like that one time the threads first disappeared

<@875753704685436938> do you agree on this being the "worst opening paragraph in a fantasy book from 2024"?
Cus I don't xd
here's 2019's winner:

> Space Fleet Commander Brad Brad sat in silence, surrounded by a slowly dissipating cloud of smoke, maintaining the same forlorn frown that had been fixed upon his face since he�d accidentally destroyed the phenomenon known as time, thirteen inches ago.

Nobody can tell me that isn't an insanely fun opening
Noooo they are specifically written for the contest and are not from real books
*how could they*
Found all the winners and dishonourable mentions
https://www.bulwer-lytton.com/2024
> P��gf�th wrestled with the controls of the ancient lightship, unlikely to survive the tachyon storm, but determined to deliver the cargo that would free the people of Cv�nkjh from their aeons-long vowel famine.
> Staring unblinkingly into the pleading, tear-filled eyes of yet another dame looking for me to solve all her problems, I sighed, stretched, scratched my whiskers, stuck my hind leg in the air and bent my spine at a 45-degree angle to reach down and lick my butt clean, then donned my fedora�Taco, Cat Detective, was officially on the case.
***Why is this not an actual book!?***
# there is another contest like this
https://adamcadre.ac/lyttle/
> On an otherwise fine spring morning, Helga Tottentanz learned in an exceptionally hard way that, whatever they might�ve told you in hospitality school up in Cologne, as a serving wench in Mainz�s finest inn in 451 A.D., you don�t greet a battle-weary and obviously stressed general named Attila, fresh from crossing the Carpathians at the cost of ten thousand or so men, with an overly cheery �Hi, Hun.�
> She was poured into the red latex dress like Jello poured into a balloon, almost bursting at the seams, and her zaftig shape was awesome to behold, but I knew from the look on her face and the .45 she held pointing at me, that this was no standard client of my detective agency, but a new collection agency tactic to get me to pay my long-overdue phone bill.
> Magnus was in a tough spot...the Icelandic Police were pressing him to cough up the name of the top capo in each of the 3 main cities in which the Mafia operated�Reykjavik, Akureyri, and Middelf�threatening to lock him away for life if he didn't, but he knew that if he ratted out the Reykjavikingur or the Akureyringur the Mob would kill him for sure�so he just gave them the Middelfingur.

What a coincidence

� How bold!
*Zinzana smirks into her glass, sipping on her alcohol.*
� I am the daughter of a loving father. I am priceless.
*She straightens her back, looking the man beside her up and down with a confident smile. Her blood red eyes are dancing on the features of the moon elf's face, analyzing it for herself, storing the memory into a safe place in her brain.*
� But perhaps my statement is not too comprehensible for some. I am valued more than one would believe, a privilege not all can experience. I am not only a daughter to my father, after all, but the next successor of the family as well.
*She stares into the crowd, bowing her head as a greeting to the guests who do the same to her when walking by.*

We are dumb
I'll write it up after food

https://youtube.com/shorts/qD-kYZKyVQ0?si=Tzhdl2FToXgx7121
Okay xD
Dear <@463641084971712514>, You've reached level 55!
Is that a surprise tho?

# Dehydrate
**Range** 30 feet; **Area** 5-foot burst
**Defense** Fortitude (see text); **Duration** 1 minute
You stir the inner fire of all things within the area, driving out moisture.
> this is just flavor
All creatures in the area take 1d6 persistent fire damage with a basic Fortitude save; creatures with the water or plant traits get a result one degree of success worse than they rolled.
> 1d6 persistent fire damage against basic Fortitude save. This makes sense. Just (1d6)*0.5 on success, 1d6 on fail, 1d6*2 on crit fail. This save does nothing else 
The spell ends for a creature when its persistent damage ends.
> will be important later

A creature affected by dehydrate attempts an additional Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns, before rolling to recover from the persistent damage.
> so at end of turn:
> 1. take persistent damage
> 2. roll fortitude save and take the result from the bottom row, nothing else is affected by this
> 3. roll recovery check for persistent damage
It can forgo this additional save if it consumed water or a similar hydrating liquid within the last round (drinking typically requires a single action).
> drinking water or hydrating liquid simply auto succeeds the fortitude save that is mentioned right above **for that turn**

> below are the results for the end of turn repeating check, not the starting check
Success The creature takes no additional effect.
Failure The creature is enfeebled 1 until the end of its next turn.
Critical Failure The creature is enfeebled 2 until the end of its next turn.
Makes sense now?
So those effects can apply every round if the additional fortitude is failed
https://youtu.be/sJptKZHdARc?si=n25JcyyemW1CPFVD
Yes
As long as the persistent dmg is up
Ye
Yep, we were dumdum
I think that's what we thought originally
And then we were like *naaaah*
I never thought this xd
I did xD
I somehow never registered that the bottom bottom part exist
U said that only triggers on the first basic fortitude
So we were like okay
Fair enough xD
I didn't really get the additional save but now ye it makes sense

Mikor legyen 0th session?
Kinek mikor lenne j� a h�ten-j�v� h�ten
H�tk�znapokkal nem tudok sz�molni, max d�lut�nokkal (from 2pm)
H�tv�g�im szabadok
Nekem is j�k a h�tk�znap d�lut�nok ilyen 4 �ra k�rny�k�t�l. K�vi h�ten is kb �gy lesz j�, viszont most a h�tv�g�n csak vas�rnap leszek szabad
Vas�rnapok j�k, csak nem tudok sok�ig maradni, aludni is kell m�snapra
M�jus v�g�ig nem lesz biztos napunk j�t�kra. H�tr�l h�tre fogjuk kital�lni mikor �r�nk majd r�.
Alright
Szombatot csak az�rt nem szeretn�m majd k�s�bb se fix�lni mert azok mindig a csapatos tali napok, meg azokra mindig van program majdnem mindenkinek
Ebben a h�napban m�g szabad vagyok. Majd febru�rban kezd�dik az egyetem
Nekem legel�bb k�vi h�t cs�t�rt�k lesz j�. Ut�na m�r nincs vizsga

You're right yeah. But this time it's not an irl issue. It's a schedule issue.
Idk h�tk�znapok nekem gond n�lk�l mehetn�nek online, befejezn�nk 9kor vagy 10kor a j�t�kot �s ott vagyok az �gyban, nem kell m�g hazabuszoznom
Same with vas�rnap
H�tk�znap nekem munka ut�n rohannom kellene buszra, eljutni t�megk�zleked�ssel hozz�d, valszeg r�videbbre fogni a sessiont hogy ut�na este 10re *tal�n* haza�rjek
Nem megoldhatatlan
But inconvenient
h�t ha nem h�tk�znapra tessz�k
h�tv�g�n k�nnyebben megoldhat� hogy mondjuk mikor kezd�nk �s meddig j�tszunk
azt�n max ha valamelyik h�tv�ge nem j�n �ssze kin�z�nk egy h�tk�znapi napot onlinera
-# *I might gonna need to drop chains because of the irl problem... huh...*
�s ha mondjuk k�t hetente lenne irl �s esetleg tudsz m�sokn�l aludni n�ha?
de ha
ugye h�tv�g�n lenne session
biztos nem tartana estig
f�leg nem olyan k�s�ig
A szombattal nincs bajom, azzal Daninak van gondja
A vas�rnap meg akkor j�, ha nem d�lut�n-este megy, hanem d�lel�tt-d�lut�nig
H�tk�znapi ottalv�s pedig, m�g k�thetente is, es�lytelen
h�tv�g�re gondoltam
de yeah
�n sem akarn�k irl sessiont este 9-10-ig xd
persze az is v�ltozhat

Eredetileg 23. lenne a k�vi session mert nem ez a h�t a tails h�t

Most ez a p�ntek se nem j� h�ten van, se nem cs�t�rt�k�n xD
�gyhogy gond egy sz�l se, 23-a session originally is xD
A 30-ai h�ten nincs session

We'll see how the session will go, i'm not feelin too well, i'll need to drink a neocitran or something
My throat is already giving up i don't have voice xddd
Do you want to push it and lose it for the whole weekend or let it rest and possibly recover by tomorrow?
I have no idea what to do :')
You are sick, go rest duduhead
Take some medicine (like neocitran) if you have
Yeah i will take neocitran for sure
I just don't wanna leave you guys hanging, it's been ages since the last session

Quasit is best
I like this art of them
and then there is the pf2e version xD
which is just old
Spider mech is cool and all but I feel like it would take out most of the hardship from playing a physically disabled character
It would feel more like you are controlling a fully healthy character with none of the drawbacks
In gameplay
It's like when someone in media gets the perfect, most streamlined prosthetic first and it's like they never lost a thing
Of course in rp you can go into the lack of feeling things
In opposite, a wall climbing super agile, super tanky, super maneuverable character
Which is cool
But that could be more of a late game thing
I think it should go from battle wheelchair to super spider mecha of destruction naturally during the course if a campaign
So they still have the clunky, struggling phase for a while and then as they grow and have access to more resources, they get to upgrade to the peak of prosthetics and whatnot
A slow and gradual change would be nice to see during a long campaign
This reminded me of a mage in a manga i read
Had a very cool "wheel chair"

there was also another character, of significantly lower rank yet he still had access to such an item

I think its a very cool fantasy equivalent if u dont like the wheel chair or the mecha look in your games/worlds

I'm not sure who is interested,  Huniepop is free to keep. It is a hentai game so I'm not gonna link it.

Tran-sition
So like, when he was a shapeshifter, could he shift the earrings too?
Wait wait
I got too excited and forgot to color the shoulders
He had that earring in each of his forms, always in that exact position
Maaaan, i wanna play a shapeshifter again
Went from smug ass to terrorized fish
XDDDD

xDD
I found out the secrets
:O

lgbtq is not nsfw xD
yeah, but what about berry sorbet?:D
(sorry, I'm sleep deprived and decided to play it safe)
I'm too dumb to know what sorbet is
Food
Like ice cream
Kinda
you puree fruit and freeze it
no milk added
Usually made from fruits
So it's also not nsfw xd
fruit ice cream that is just fruit puree without milk (so lactose intolerant ppl can have it)
*You say that until you walk in on someone enjoying a delicious cup of sorbet*
ok, sorry I wasn't sure where to put this, I've been told off to be more sensitive on otehr servers, like any talk of sexuality is NSFW
I mean, true in a sense. Sexuality is not for the workplace in a literal sense. Unless you're a pimp or a butterfly
Or an escort
or too sexy for your shirt
this is NOT my work, it's from one of my crochet groups, but it looks like such fun!
(less so if you have to clean it...)
there this is NSFW, right?
Yep
My god. Mango sorbet hits so damn hard. Also black currant aaaa.

Definitely based, sent a heart xd (probably won't do anything)
But *maybe it will*
XD

XD sounds like a vibe yes
Sometimes I also miss believing that I am smart. /jk
Drakken had nice characters. I'm still sad for Bastian, who just wanted a normal life in the end.
*sigh* not funny ://
Me sad
Cause of drakken?
Cuz he is still making fun of how I couldnt play a smart wizard xddd
But yeah i also miss drakken
I mean non of us can really pretend to be smarter than we actually are xdd
Idk I feel like he was smart enough feeling
Honestly, readong back the rps xd
He was a pretty big himbo
And with zero social awereness
I don't
I was just joking
Hmpf >>
And you did play a smart character. I never felt like Bucco was dumb. He was questionable and emotionally kinda whack but smart.
Ooh interesting
When did he feel questionable?
Slapping his sister after they both lost their father xD
Ah yes
When he went out into the woods and carved a phrase into his skin
That was something
When he was
(jk)
It was his edgy werewolf alpha beta phase
J�l wan twink master
*van
*�n is fel tudom sorolni at ABC-t, nem csak Bucco*
At least i was twink ***master*** ;)
*Everyone's favourite twink is in my possession*
De, idk �gy hiszem az�rt minden tett�re megvolt a kell�en logikus magyar�zat
<a:hellmage_emilyyeh:833496986657357824>
Isn't that Ori?
Hmph
Nah def juno
Bucco was a good character, you made him unforgettable
Yes noone talks about him ToT jk
AND YOU HATED HIM
When someone says Bucco, everyone knows everything
That's how you can tell he was a very good character
That's just a thing
At least you remember the things you hate XD
When a character becomes unforgetable, iconic, that's when you know you did a good job at playing them and making them real
<:point:951578243415302235> <:point:951578243415302235> <:point:951578243415302235>
Hm
Idk, i mean i know juno was iconic bc he was a twink and he was in the science team, and papa marco.
No matter if the character was evil, good, chaotic, lawful, dumb, smart, anything
If everyone knows the name, everyone remembers, that's the best thing one can achieve
Papa marco was more iconic than Juno xDDD
I miss my spells U^U
I wanna play a wizard again
I wanna play a shapeshifter U^U
Pope Francis is neato
Pretty chill
Yeah
xD
What I remember from Juno is Papa Marco and the strawberry flavored potions
And that he saved our asses with the giga potions of anti-death
I always forget that spell's name
And the amplified heals
When they worked
Lol
I wanna play with me boi one day again
I remember csiperke was sassy
I still have so much I could do
*classy
Thank you, cause I don't XD
It was a shit show for me
CLASSY
I tried and failed
That's what I remember when I think of her
As a player I didn't do a good enough job to make the character and I didn't enjoy it that much either
De gyerekek nem tudom mi�rt szomorkodtok, m�g van b�ven id�nk, drakkennek m�g van 3 sessionje h�tra
True
And it's not like we can't rp if people want to
What do you want?
There's still the Feywild exploration and the coming of the space age
You're the one who wants to play Bucco, so I just tossed up the idea
It's always an option as long as at least one person wants to rp with you
*I know you wanna go be a space orc just so Bucco wouldn't have to give that ring to Csiperke* XD
*So Csiperke will have to play interplanetar tax collector*
Bastian was taken by his martyr complex so I can't T-T
Bring in one of your other boys
Behozzuk mint szellem. �gy is minden franchiseba kell egy olyan
The one that still lives, I mean
The one that wants to be the caspian (or whichever country was that) king
Guys i forgot that Juno later became a father after the feywild expeditions
There are mini Junos running around in the world
Damn, he pulled someone?
Petra
Or rather someone pulled him
He married a girl
*What a nice lesbian couple*
Nice
XDDDDD
I didn't know that
Juno shows up with his wife from the Feywild: Titania
Oh wait yeah we have Bastian's son as well
Eyo?
AH YEAH REALLY
gays
i mean guys
ma egy tala?
�n bemegyek am�gyis a v�rosba

Just imagine, Juno comes out of the feywild with a satyr family
AZTA TE M�G ITT VAGY A SZERVEREN???

from the ongoing steam fest these are some games I spotted that I can recommend as a pickup to anyone looking for some strategic games:
the Dungeons series is some really nice city builder/godgame type strategy game
Against the Storm is a banger rougelite citybuilder
The Last Train Home is highly praised to have a really good atmosphere and some good gameplay to boot
Crusader Kings 3 if it's your type of game
Stellaris if you happen to have infinite time to invest into an extremely complex rts 4x game
Age of Empires 2 is a classic with a great campaign series
Frostpunk is extremely cheap rn and is a great game
Shadow Tactics (and it's standalone DLC) is a really fun tactical game that stole my heart

I'd like to announce the happy news that under Trump's administration all americans legally count as female!
***Every. Single. American.***

Why?
Well it is put in law that "Male" person is someone who produces the small reproductive cell at conception.

<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
@everyone
While we are a smaller group and ofc it doesn't happen much anyways but:
Should we automod out twitter/X links from the server due to it's recent open support towards Naci groups?
O.O
xDDD
Dicegod CHILL
I don't use Twitter
Let the Twitter users decide
If there's any
yea but simply having an embargo is something that is already a great deal of support, just idk if it would effect anyone
If we banned every platform that was financed and moderated by a morally questionable person, we'd have nothing to show
Also, wouldn't this affect others outside of the core gang?
Shouldn't we put it in a place where at least Fonzie and
I wanted to bring it up here primarily
Izzy could see and say what they want
if there is not a big pushback here I'll put up a vote in <#1282335045142708317>
on joining this protest or not

<@618475228695232532>
*Imma say Tabazsi*
If it would open for people, that would be great
I don't use twitter so idc honestly xd but even if i did use it, it still wouldn't really tingle my brain unless twitter desperately wanted to shove nazi stuff down my throat, so as long as it doesn't happening, idk it's not really necessary
I quite literally don't care who owns a company as long as they don't want to force their own bs and beliefs down my throat
Will twitter show naci bs down your throat now?
no

Will Elon use the money he earns from this to support naci cause, thus making it more premanent in our world?
yes

Yeah, but we literally don't even use Twitter
you two don't
there are peeps who do, and even if you don't clicking those links is income
I'm sorry but i just can't see nazi stuff gaining power in the world, especially not in europe
So i still don't really care
Or in my case I only occasionally save some art from Twitter users, but I don't have an account and also I try to avoid it and search for a different platform to save them from
Hm
It could happen again
History does repeat itself
germany has HUGE nazi problems recently
I think europeans suffered from nazis *enough* to be smarter than that
I have faith in europeans
Europe is not that retarded
Not as much as the USA
We suffered from russians too, and
That *is going super well for Ukraine*
Russia is mostly asia
Doubt
and funnily enough if the Trump tarifs go through europe's main option for trade will be russia
and china
neither of those sound fun
Nost of Russia's cities are west
Back on the topic tho, i don't see why keeping twitter accessible would mean a threat to us
I never said so
it is just
acting for a good cause
cus I don't want bad for other people
Siberia is a large part of Russia that is super barren, and that is the eastern side
Or at least it's more to the east
Sure, we can ban Twitter
Why not?
So... nazism is a taboo for a reason xd i don't think we'd need to fear it
If it has to be a platform, I'd say Twitter is the most ban worthy
National socialism can hide behind many things, and sometimes people don't even know
it's simply a current protest to show that the world doesn't take it well, awareness
Not just taboo, it's straight up illegal in many part of europe.
Because it's not always sold as: Hey, wanna hate the minority?
<:point:951578243415302235>
I generally don't care about these things either but I have no personal stake in this anyway
A lot of places give you prison time if you try to further it's ideology while in germany you can be jailed for a singular sieg heil
Aside from not wanting this potentially snowballing into another idiotic world calamity
And that is why Muskrat fucked his european market shares yesterday xD
I wonder if elon would be jailed now that he did it on international tv xDDD
It is not illegal in america
Only in a few select states
as in like if he travelled to germany
I bet it's not the first time some megacorps or something of the sort spread some ideology to the rest of the world
Yeah and that's why i don't think it matters if we support twitter or not, because nazism will not rise here
Oh yeah, I'd say who knows, but probably not
But they can find a large community on the platform
Of course, if it wasn't Twitter
they'd find another platform
So then it's a two 'fine by me's so far
A proper let it be banned and Dani

Is this from The Good Place? XD
I actually don't know XD

Let the consequences hit him where they hurt
*Politics always brighten one's day, huh?*
its important to pay attention to it cus most politics have global effects
*especially the ones happening in counries that own basically most of the internet*
I know
But it's not like one can escape politics
A csapb�l is mindig az folyik
I barely touched it until like 2-3 yrs ago
Mindegyikb�l, �lland�an
Politics are everywhere in most anything
I do like debate but as someone who likes to be a devil's advocate it takes so much time and energy

snow can be VERY powdery
https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/1i5aolk/look_at_this_powder
And usually, I still have the same standing as the one I started with
so it basically ends up as just a yap spiral
Unnecessary and annoying
talking about politics is sometimes just good to spread awareness to people who don't know that much about it
Yeah, absolutely
But in this day and age I don't think the spreading of news is the problem, it's that the news are unreliable because most sources are biased and unreliable
I do get news. So many news
But very few are the way they actually are
It gets muddled
not in this case
Musk is a weirdo menace
why I pay attention what places I get it from
*this message was sponsored by GROUND NEWS*
xD
Yeah, I've heard of them
But I'm also generally distrustful
(I don't use ground news btw just was funny)
Even if they say they're authentic
it takes time to build trust
But I'm also just one person who is fallible
And hypocritical as well
like, I know who were reasonable and well checking over the time I followed them and such
ok xD

https://theonion.com/trump-claims-he-can-overrule-constitution-with-executiv-1830106306/
```WASHINGTON�Saying his latest executive order was legal due to an �underutilized but totally feasible workaround,� President Trump claimed Tuesday that he could overrule the U.S. Constitution by means of the relatively obscure �no one will stop me� loophole. �My critics say a constitutional amendment or at least an act of Congress is necessary to end birthright citizenship, but what they don�t realize is that a seldom-evoked administrative guideline ensures I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, because zero people will stand in my way,� said Trump, adding that the largely unheard-of clause allows him to circumvent normal legal proceedings because it�s not like anyone in any branch of government remains effective enough to prevent him from doing so. �Though few modern presidents have made use of it, this loophole has always given the nation�s chief executive unilateral power over the Constitution. Its provisions dictate that the president can sidestep any checks and balances on his power once he has abused his authority so many times that no one can keep track anymore.� Trump added that while his opponents may try to challenge his executive order in court, the loophole also states that by then he will have achieved his immediate political aims.```

*At least you managed to achieve your dreams boy...*
oh yea she is probably not gonna be available for the greatwyrm fight XD
Yep
I guess we'll go after them after she gave birth? Do we have a deadline?
Scorpio would never allow her to come
Then we will need some big health potions

Let's prep some

Just

Nah, just fucking with you
dw she'll cry again when the greatwyrm onetaps him
The drama can be cool

Thinking about what would happen if someone would die and would leave the rest behind
cus *someone* forgot they need a specific thing to survive the first attack it makes
I hope you're not looking at me. Arden's not the dragon slayer here
Scorpio will still have Luan, he'll only give it to Yria on the wedding, and if they have to go greatwyrmhunt in 2 months, he won't do the wedding yet xD
No, he needs to come back alive to do the wedding
Wait, so she's already pregnant, but you will have the wedding too?
Pregananant wasn't planned btw xddd
I thought so
I love how she didn't go like "oh yea yea I remember what I have to do dw"
but "oh that is slowing down the wedding"
xD
In these stories it just happens
Like people don't know how it works or just don't care
????
Am confused xD
*i need to wash my face goddamnit*
Yall are
read the greatwyrm flashback again then
I don't know when a wedding would be ideal, because if it were me I wouldn't want to be wed while I'm having morning sickness, or a big belly, or while my infant is screaming for constant attention
SO NOT READYYY
So maybe like some years

I GENUINELY DON'T REMEMBER
DON'T PUNISH ME FOR THIS
ANNYI MINDEN T�RT�NT
I'm sure he'll tell you
I'm telling you, one of the greatwyrm abilities can onetap the entire nearby area and you are the only person who has a way to defend against it
The breath weapon?
I guess?
I have a drugged wall of force?
eyyyyy you got it XD
cus even with a successful save it would probably leave most ppl close to death xD
Step 1: Set up juices up WoF
Step 2: Survive
Step 3: Profit
Yeah i know i have stuff that's showed in the flashback :'D
good-good, they were there so you know what things to expect
Sadly tho, my druggie WoF doesn't last long
it doesn't have to
At least he got some last toughts knowing how he did xD.
Well, maybe we need to use it just once
# :'D
but if I run a greatwyrm that 100% gonna melt through other kind of magical barriers so yea XD
That's why you write letters
So when you die, maybe people can get the memo
If you wanna tell them something and you are treading deadly waters
Good job, I like it. Feels sad tho xd
Dear <@886672003396927530>, You've reached level 52!

Okay, and do we have a platform we could stand on?
Or fly
We have 2 month to prepare
Yes actually
I have fly that covers everyone
get a coracle
-# (I'm not sure everyone has got the chance to do that tho. Bastian didn't have his goodbyes)
xDDD
But even fly won't last if one gets knocked down
That's why you need to prep before things, when you have downtime

Or any superhero comics really
This fucking setting is just a differently flavored superhero world
lol
Tell me I'm wrong XD
We start as some normies and every single time we end up as the saviors of the xy region, island, continent, world, realm, plane
Universe
The end of times
I want something else
It would be neat if there was a campaign that was about something more interesting
like what?
Heists, researching stuff, solving mysteries that don't involve some world ending conspiracy
EXPEDITION
That too
sure
There are millions of things that could be done
But it always trickles down to us having to save some place
thats the point of fantasy
I have a character idea already
Not always
Not Alton or Zeuss unfortunately
palapin?
Yes, most likely a palapin xD
Fantasy is just a setting, in which you could manage a tavern, become the greatest magician, heister, outlaw,
what have you
Doesn't have to be about you having to be the savior of all
It would be nice every once in a while to have a lower stake, more personal campaign
Honestly, now that i'm so hyped over Six of Crows, it'd be fun runninng it as a heist adventure/campaign xD
It would be cool
The objective? Save this scientist from the world's safes prison
XD
*Saving again*
Not the world
Just get this person back
*Let's sell his ass afterwards to the highest bidder*
You absolutely can xD
Cool
I'd be down
*Campaign idea: Try to escape from fantasy North Korea with all your loved ones intact*
I can attend next Monday's session <:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
Although I might be very tired xD
We could play Dungeon Keeper
How cool would that be
Manage our own *little* dungeon
just gitgud smh
Anything. I want variety
In a **fantasy** setting I don't want to be restrained by the same plotline being played out over and over again
I like saving the world, but I don't like saving the world every time
<:catcry_peasantversion:1052945999196344360>
*but work from 5 to 5* <:catcry_peasantversion:1052945999196344360> <:catcry_peasantversion:1052945999196344360> <:catcry_peasantversion:1052945999196344360>
Sheesh
Probably would need another system to do it any longer than 15 or so sessions.
like we had with Witchlight?
Oh wait I forgot
You don't save the world in chains either xD
true
but its depressing xd
or like
yeah
depressing
Yeah. You'll see eventually \:D
when?
I have no idea when we're starting. Schedules are everywhere right now, some peeps are in exam periods.
*solid, naturally attractive flesh* xDDDD
We'll have to wait some to find a time that works for everyone.
NOOO
NOT THE YEAST TABLET
ew
Any weekday late-afternoon online
Except thursday
Nope
For me
Yes xD
Oh for you yeah
Same
We could probably do it in a week by week basis, but that is a bit more planning. If we're up for it we could plan something for early february maybe?
For me it depends on schedule which I do not know yet xd
De akkor most online?
No, you are only saving souls
Nem irl akartuk?
Dani nagyony irl-re szeretn� de idk szerintem az nem fog m�k�dni xd
�n �r�ln�k ha m�k�dne, de lehet t�bbet lesz majd online mint irk
*l
Yeah, I liked reclaiming our stolen personality traits
I'd prefer irl but I gave up on that already xF
We'll do split, online and irl seeing how things line up for peeps, but a monthly irl would be nice.
We'll see how things turn out.
be right there just popcorn :D
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
dani lesz akkro?
Lesz
Hopefully
Ha vissza�r a boltb�l xD

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.

When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

Eeeehh. Something happened?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3nBbvfdwkI
I mean, did you enter the store? (jk)
They pretended as a test that I was robbed while on break xd
WHAT
xD
DAFUQ IS THAT
Wtf
***on a 12 hr shift***
I thought like 2-3 month worth pay was gone and I was gonna have to pay xdd
Yess xD
It was a test, and ye it was a bit my fault xd
Oh yeah no. You never have to pay for those, like ever. Nobody would work in that field if you would have to.
dw you never have to luckily
it is against law to make you compensate for money being off in the kassza
Cause I should've put some things away and put my register in break mode
But still xdd
Uuh
do not ever pay that
I'd have to it seems
Alrighty xd
Yeah. Insane...
if they say you have to just say that you'll forward the case to a lawyer
For small missing stuff we do pay
no
don't
Sure I will xD
that's the company stealing from you
Eeh
easy slam dunk cases are usually taken up pro-bono or what it's called
you don't have to pay a cent
lot of people forget that lawyers love winning easy cases cus they get paid by the losing party
But also it's our responsibility to operate it correctly
yes
they can have stuff like, you get writeups, and maybe fired or put on some improvement plan
but they can't make you pay / fuck with your pay
That's how I know it as well. You can't be forced to pay. But I'll check around just to be sure
Ye idk honestly
Might be something in my contract tho who knows xDD
*might have accidentally made a pact with a devil*
even if it is in the contract, if it is not legal, then the whole contract is just invalid XD
Fair enough xdd
It seems by law we have to compensate
If it was our fault
damn
hungarian laws strike again
xD
If not like in the case of a proper robbery then ye no
I mean
It's logical tbh
At least to me
If I steal from the register or lose stuff from it from negligence then that's on me
And I should compensate
I don't think that that's a wild thought xdd
most reasonable countries have this:
Illegal Deductions: Unless the employer obtains a court judgment, an employer may not, directly or indirectly, withhold, deduct or require payment of all or part of an employee's wages for any purposes. Examples that are not allowed include deductions for alleged: theft; damage; breakage; poor quality work; damage to employer's property including accidents involving employer vehicles or equipment; or failure to collect payment by a customer, including 'dine-and-dashes' and shoplifting.
if they want your money, they can get court judgment on it
if not, they should increase security
Fair enough ye
security is not your job
But I do have some responsibilities when it comes to my stuff and register
Like putting it in break mode xdd
*when I go on a break*
yes, if you don't do that, they should send you on better training, or add a warning, etc
I'm sure if it had been real and I was missing like 500k then they wouldnt have me like pay it on the spot
I'm sure there's a process
I just don't know it
Cause thank god I didn't have to pay xDDD
I checked too and hungarian laws are... Fucked
Funfact, if you get robbed it doesn't automatically absolve your obligation to pay it back. This is so so so dumb
*dafuq*
xD
You are only absolved if you can prove that the thing that happened was out of your control and you still tried your best to avoid it
"I asked nicely"
you done everything
you shouldn't be required to jump into a knife
In this case since �gi didn't set it to break mode... She could be fined by the labor affairs department.  If it was real of course.
Yes those situations are automatically out of your power
You can't be fined if you get robbed. But theft is a different matter
You just love to see hungarian laws
But still, testing you on a 12h shift is insane
Video: "We are testing the most interesting hotels in Europe"
first hotel: has a personal sauna in your room
me living in finland: yea... and?
xD
Soo
I've severely underestimated the amount I would've been paying if it was real but it's alright xDDD
I would've probably just died on the spot instead of crying
A whopping 4 million damage xDDDD
Wtf how? O.o
Huh?!
So the thing they "stole"
Was a roll of those sticker points
Each supposedly "worth" 2k
With 2k of em on a full roll xddd
That sounds bs
but if really that much. uh
U get one after spendin 2k
So technically they worth that
Yeah no that's just dumb
And u can exchange them for discounts on certain items
So it could create quite the damage
If an entire roll is stolen
Yeah but not 4mil damage most likely
Insignificant basically to the store but ye, not to me xDDDD
discount like a couble hundred forints?
This just sounds like they want to put the fear of god in you so that you would **never** half-ass anything
No like 14k from a 20k item
For example
It was exactly that yes
damn
they just made that up to scare you
I'll definitely go to glassdoor and some similar places to leave a few anonymous reviews on it
I mean it's not an exact damage
It's just figuratively how much I "would've lost"
still this is just emotional torture
It works tho xD
Nah but they had just told me I would've followed
I'm over it, just happy to not be fined millions for stickers xDD
I just realized since it is anonymous I could just leave a review myself
It was my fault tho
Like bro xd
Can we get over it?
They also did suck at telling us exactly how what when but ye
https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1iayi9o/uranium_ore_emitting_radiation_inside_a_cloud
I'm just happy to not pay xdd
yea, I believe that, I still don't believe people should get away with bad practices without any lashback, that's how the world will keep turning worse and worse

There was this one time when me and a couple friends went on a bus, sat down and all, and an old guy (I can't remember if he was alone or was escorted by someone) got up on the bus, walked to the back and I looked down on the floor and I saw a very long, very wide stream of blood
An ambulance was called
One of the old man's leg veins popped somehow
It was dark outside so it kinda looked like a pool of ink with only the bus's lights shining on it

while they are not out yet there are sneak peaks coming in from early birds

# Inventor
(<@242727379447971840>)
- Overdrive Fail now gives you 1 fire damage on attacks instead of nothing
- Overdrive Crit Fail only does half level (rounded up) fire damage to you
- ...uhm, that's mostly from what I see being interesting for u, weapon and armor inventor got a few more stuff but all of them are just QoL or minor buffs

# Gunslinger
(<@886672003396927530>)
- Singular Expertise removed (the +1 dmg on all firearms and crossbows)
- Slinger's Precision added in it's place: +2 precision damage on Strike with non-repeating crossbows. +1d4 precision damage on Strike with non-repeating firearms. Upgraded to +3 / +1d6 on lvl13. If you have a combination weapon that is a crossbow or firearm in ranged configuration, you use your firearm proficiency on the melee weapon version as well.
- Drifter's Reload no longer triggers reactions
- Sniper's One Shot, One Kill now triggers on first successful strike with that weapon in the encounter, even if outside the first turn
- Vanguard's Living Fortification now lasts until end of first turn not start of it.
- Munitions Crafter completely reworked: "You gain the Advanced Alchemy Benefits as described on page 174 of the PC2 and you can create a number of daily consumables equal to 4 + half your level (rounded up). These consumables must be bombs or alchemical ammunition.  You gain a formula book that contains the formula for black powder and four 1st level types of common or uncommon alchemical ammunition or bombs of your choice.  It goes on to describe more about how many doses you create in a day.  But, you cannot use advanced alchemy to craft horns or kegs of black powder."

> Context, for those unfamiliar - some anti-woke gamers made 'The Real Game Awards' and gave the Best Racing Game award to a game called Nightmare Kart, completely unaware that the developer was a transgender furry (and I think also a lesbian, though I can't remember). Unhappy with this revelation, several anti-woke people tried to review-bomb the game, to minimal effect.
holy shit the puzzle is HARD

I HAVE FINISHED READING THE BOOK
now it is time to set up
and finish the player's guide
*Not Nika seeing what her next secret box bookmail got her and heavily weighing wether she should pause her current read to read the new book, or be patient*
*Like, how could she wait with a beeshboy MMC on the cover so hot?*
*be patient my child*
finish your current one or decide upon never returning to it, as if you put it down once, it will never be picked up again
That's not true, i picked up books many times after i took a break
And my current read is also already a lifetime favourite
*Hek*
still, why cut it in half
the new one won't run away either dw
<:shittycry:1331345315428700202>
Fine
Patience
<:itsfine:1331345537609371659>

*Also looks at the book Nika originally planned to read after her current read*
*Not that book being 990+ pages long*
*Not at all*

Today's creation

https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/s/HcEln05VYl
just asking, how reasonable does this sound?

the special case that is mentioned here why I say it is reasonable on the move together: the person I'm talking to *needs* constant supervision, if they are alone and their illness triggers they are most likely dead, and the ex is the only person they know and trust enough
Ez pontosan milyen c�lb�l kell? Ennek a szem�lynek szeretn�l t�mogat�st adni, mert a kapcsolat�ra kihat az exes �sszek�lt�z�s, vagy � k�rdezte, hogy g�z lehet-e ez a kapcsolatnak?
It has reason, but that "I know you wouldn't cheat because then I would" do xy is a bit excessive
The phrasing at least
Yeah, I tought the same. It feels like a threat.
You do you with how you deal with friends who cheated in their relationships
Just maybe bring the energy down a notch
I don't understand the being in your ex's bed part
Like
Yeah
But yeah I agree it sounds like a bad situation. I know I wouldn't remain in a relationship if they moved in together with their ex.
Didn't the ex move in?
Or they moved in with the ex?
Yeah no. That's a bit weird.
I
Even then
Why one bed?
They should have 2 separate beds
Or at least an inflatable bed or a couch
*Because this is a YA novel scenario*
Was there an issue where they got in bed together?
Like they *had to* or wha?
Cause other than an incredibly tiny apartment or a medical close to emergency scenario where I have to keep a *really close eye* on someone
I just don't see how that's relevant
Idk I'm just lost, I think im missing some context xd
Yeah
Some context is still missing for sure
Like ex moved in cause noone else could cause medical reasons ye?
Yep
But why the question of the one bed?
Dunno
Even in a smaller apartment (that is not one of those super tiny, borderline unlivable places) there should be enough room for at least an inflatable bed or mattress
Or sleeping bag
Ye I just don't see how we jump from necessary medical needs to getting into bed together with your ex for any reason
And if they somehow would cheat then how would anyone else know?
They could just not tell anyone. It's not like anyone could look into it personally because there's noone who could
Idk I feel like if they worry about this instead of the other genuinely needing medical attention and not having access anything better than *their ex* (while the other option is potential death) then... I don't it's healthy for either of them
�n se �r�ln�k ha csak az exem lenne ott nekem de mit csin�ljak ink�bb, haljak meg egyed�l az otthonomban??
Persze k�zben ha a partnert annyira zavarja akkor mondhatja hogy bocs ezt �gy nem
Kinek mi
Ak�rhogy gondolod �t a helyzetet nincs opci� aminek j� kimenetele lehetne
M�rmint, ide�lis. A j� kimenetel az, hogy nem kock�ztatja az �let�t, ami valszeg egy p�rkapcsolat elveszt�s�t jelenti.
(but honestly that's the minor issue, especially if you can't trust your partner to take the ex's place in this situation.)
*If* the current partner lets their insecurity get the better of them, or you know, just the long distance relationship not working for them in general
In case of long distance, she's just a victim of circumstance.
I don't remember if it was long distance or just that they can't live together for some other reason made me think it was a l.d.r.
Either way
Don't know much, but even if I did, I probably shouldn't dabble in this to begin with
sry had to go for a bit after posting XD
leme read
doesn't really matter, this are set opinions on general cases mostly, take it as a discussion
Akkor nincs mit megoldani, csak v�lem�nykimond�s
Ok�
I have very harsh view on cheating and it is extremely rarely forgivable, I have seen like, 1 or 2 things that were cheating but can be like, let go kinda in very specific circumstances
Ok�, az a te dolgod mennyire szeretn�l standoffish lenni vele
it was just mentioned as being in the ex's bed, I do not really know what was meant under it so I was exploring options
Csak azt nem �rtem, hogyha a bar�tod, �s semmi ilyenre nem adott k�vetkeztet�st akkor mi�rt felt�tlen�l ilyen kinda threatening hangv�tel�en kell kimondani
yes, there was no really any other option so this is perfectly fair imo
I always make sure to be very stern when I express my views on cheating it is not something where I move an inch and I do like to make sure that is understood
Mint amikor mondod, hogyha Nika helyett a te billenty�zetedhez �rne Reg�, akkor elt�rn�d a kezeit. �rtem hogy nem szeretn�d, csak damn
0-100
yea
1. warning
2. very stern warning
3. probably a good punch to set a remminder
dicegod..
xD
no
XD
It is agreeing with its creator
You can be a proud creator now
but yea there are things where I am drawing very hard lines
probs a bit extremist
but idc
xD
Alright
That's alright. A megfogalmaz�s volt kicsit durva. Especially towards someone who's already on the ground
I guess we all have those strong feelings towards something
igen csak n�ha az ember fel� aki fel� ir�nyul nem megfelel� vagy felesleges xd
Ja, de az m�r rajtuk m�lik
They can choose to disregard it
F�leg text form�tumban
Valaki csak �tugorhatja ha nem k�v�ncsi r�
I wanted to give the message that there is basically no saving circumstance, both for cheating and for accessing someone's mailing
one is an extreme moral issue
other is a bit less serious moral issue but one of the most harshly prosecuted crimes that doesn't involve ppl dying
No saving circumstance except those one or two times you gave someone the leeway
So cheating is okay *sometimes*
But checking someone's mail, that's new
cheating is okay when you are forcefully locked into a relationship with no way out
this is ofc simplifying just wanted to show the areas and direction I say maybes
but I have learned there are no 100%s in life
Yeah
(also why I wrote *basically*, I always try to note this "there are no 100%s")
Basically is just the wrong word then
why?
"there is basically 0 chance of this happening" -> means "there is very little chance of this happening"
so it is used when it doesn't exactly mean the next part
Basically is closer to fundamentally
In its entirity, from the ground up
Just phrasing
Don't mind me
XD
this conversation is so hectic
Was there ever any that wasn't? XD
We are not a well oiled machine's gears
We are like a jigsaw puzzle that is made out of pieces from different jigsaw puzzles
We make a whole picture but it looks like a collage
But we have fun
Or at least we have interesting comvos
My head hurts
It hurt all day
Need for sleep
take it off, it might need some deep cleaning
Probably
I wish I could sometimes
I might became too pessimistic for this anymore xd
Or im just too damn exhausted from this week and travel
Who knows
These are trying times
But there's still a lot of good and fun
Im just too much reevaluating
*doing
For no reason and its making me crazy at this point
As long as it doesn't hurt you more than its worth
Okay, so then it causes more harm than good
XD
I just feel like i turned inside out
When's therapy starting?
It is going
Im going next thuesday
*Cs�zd�j, innit?*
The future and the uncertain bothers me the most rn
Az �ltal�noss�gban mindenkit
Kiv�ve tal�n p�r nagyon zen embert
And my sudden urges for women. Bisexuality is a curse i feel like sometimes
Craving anything is a hassle in general, even with the most basic things
Food, water, sleep, love
But it's worth getting it
It just makes me feel shitty and confused
Whatever you need
I'm sure you can work it out with help

a school project of mine this semester where I will make an AI that can distinguish between two images (you know the ones like "is this a dog or a muffin")
I need ideas on what I could base it on
what two types of images I could focus on? :D
So you just need two picture subjects? Apes and humans
Or house cats and big cats

It's funny. It's just a shame that the real thing is so depressing
Yeah




heard smth interesting:
In pf2e you sometimes do not want to rush up to an enemy and attack it, as both you and your ally(/ies) needs to spend one or more actions to get there, let the creature reach you first, use up like 2 of it's actions, strike you once, and then you have 3 actions to retaliate
ofc, don't use this brainlessly, this won't be useful against someone like a gunmarshal who'll just shoot you from afar (although you can break line of sight there and such)
That also good tactics in general. Melee enemies are basically stunned x, until they reach you (x being the amount of actions they need to use to get to you)
Like free step action and putting an enemy prone
Cc is really good in pf xD

I'm always trying to pull at least one more "outsidey" person into my games
the Finnish studies are getting to the part with more and more exceptions ;-;
just so all <@&1320006468707029063> know how things are looking, the current character ideas are:
- local druid (somewhat melee-ish caster build)
- local fighter (unarmed-ish build)
- local monk (grappler build-ish, open to change)
dunno if <@332925665424834560> has any ideas yet?
The ship positions are a free real-estate at the moment.
Maybe our local Dudu could take a navigation position
Nika (Fanki) did mention that she's leaning towards navigating, although idk if she read that it's an int based thungy
In case anybody plans to go to Budapest between February 11-14:
The train line between Kelenf�ld and D�li p�lyaudvar will be closed on those few days, so you will have to get down at Kelenf�ld
damn, alright
Yeah i read
I guess I'll just walk instead
But i still kinda wanna navigate
Tho i'm leaning towards the "navigating thru the forest using my survival knowledge" but i guess i could also be a "yeah i know where to go and i know the map" xD

We could do physical with keeping track of crucial things in foundry.
I'll probably leave it up to each person how they want to
foundy will only have srd stuff
we'd need to pay for the phb
(which is nah, I'm still not throwing money at WotC
So a primal gish, a brawler and a striker. Will the dudu try support things as well or will they be a damage source mainly??
Support
I'll be the kind of dudu who can go in melee if necessary
But not melee focus
I'll be the kind who gives you a great bonk on yo jaw if get too close while i'm casting
Good good
So anything int or cha based seems unused so far. Also we don't have a face xD
Yeah i'll be WIS with a tiny tiny tiny tiny amount of extra INT
And Eszter mentioned she'll play smth on the simpler side
THERE IS A REVERSE K-P-T CASE
*kill me*
Hmm alrighty
If she'd prefer playing a martial I'd have no issues switching to a caster of some kind. Fish jesus could work as a cleric as well xD.
This is basically as if/when the Hungarian -val/-vel sometimes decided to change the last letter into a v instead of changing themselves
Fish jesus could also work as the party's face xD *jesus leading the suicide squad*
Jesus as a cleric? Nah, impossible
Cha cleric <:gobbowhen:1188445136137502770>
<:idek:694605001502228540>
Or another bard.... Hmmmm
dance bard is basically still a monk
xD
Oh yeah
J�ssz ide a cutlerbe?
Probably a brick zone-ba j�rn�k
A cutler nekem egy kicsit messze van
another thing:
at the start, the adventure doesn't instantly group you up, during the festival there won't be anything that would turn you from strangers to some new group just slightly later (like end/second part of session 1 or smth idk how quickly this will go)
We'll manage I think
yea
just it is not the standard
Rp heavy group is rp heavy group
so I mentioned
xD
you guys can meet on the programs of the festivities and such

����
it is always a surprise for me how Valentine's Day is ***not*** about actual relationships
it is about any kind of friendship, including relationships
Isn't it a day for romance specifically? Many do these hangout things on it, but it's still about lovers. At least I think so.
Finland had a tradition there separate from the globally known valentines day
And it got kinda culturally merged
It is on the 14th and called valentines day
But they focus on friendships way more
Aaaa okay
I remember telling someone in dm-s I'll do something once home but have no clue who or what
drop me a message if you are waiting on me for smth

I was passing the time with watching videos of spooky japanese urban legend stories

Any time everyone is available to play. Weekeends are off cuz rest and family, as are mondays, thursdays and soon wednesdays as well.
Maybe v�ltakozva Tailsel cs�t�rt�k�n?
Am nem lenne h�lyes�g
De az M�rknak nem m�k�dne.
sz�val semelyik nap nem j�?
Well fridays i guess
Maybe, de M�rknak az is iffy.
J� lenne ha <@377469395007438849> is tudna mondani valamit
Also tuesdays?
M�rki azt mondja, hogy neki a szombat d�lut�n a megfelel�
Csak a szombat d�lut�n? Ami senki m�snak nem m�k�dik?
Damn

H�t
H�t xd
Mindenki dolgozik vagy tanul h�tk�znap
Sz�val az az�rt nem j� senkinek
A h�tv�ge meg az�rt mert mindenki pihenni akar
De akkor ilyen szempontb�l honestly
A h�tv�ge jobb
Nekem a h�tv�ge nem m�k�dik, minden egy�b programom h�tv�g�ken van

Nekem b�rmely h�tv�ge d�lut�n j� j�t�kra, ebb�l a cs�t �s a szerda m�r meg is van
M�rk beoszt�sa. He has almost no afternoons free
Ezt most egy�ltal�n nem rosszindulatb�l �rom/k�rdezem: 
Ha valaki tudja hogy csak egyetlen nap m�k�dik j�t�knak, egy olyan ami senki m�snak nem, akkor hogy tervez�nk j�szani?
Komolyan semmi rosszindulat nincs a k�rd�semben, de annyira fura sz�momra xD ha tudom hogy nem fogok tudni j�tszani akkor amikor mindenkinek j�, akkor nem jelentkezn�k
Tenyleg semmi rosszindulat
Tudom hogy nem tehet r�la hogy ilyen szar a beoszt�sa
Yeah ahogy a dnd is lehetne, de ofc online m�s
Meg �gy k�nnyebb h�tk�znapra rakni

oh an interesting thing that came up while talking with Nika
there are no really "evil" group on the islands
the worst are some outsider pirates or poachers, but there is no "evil tribe" or anything like that
thats kinda sad
this place was made by a single being trying to make a perfect world
then outsiders happened
xD
so they are the bad guys
yea, the Ikolf dwarves first came as basically conquerors
but had to rebell against their tyrannic king Skom Fylkir
after which they kinda integrated into the local life
although with some of their own inventions like: having permanent settlements
And spirits still don't trust them that much

#true-neutral
no surprise, this got vandalized into complete trash in less than 24 hrs
xDDD
bit confused as to what the 2nd and 3rd rows do
*column
technically the bottom left half shows everything as it is kind of mirrored
like I get
> at a given CR rating, how much HP & AC do monsters usually have
, rest seems useless?
like we compare CR with CR....
ac to hp ratios are interesting too

the cr to cr, or hp to hp shows distribution
- the more hp/ac u have, the higher the other stat is by a tiny amount on avg
- is the distribution of the hp/ac meant to be understood as... there is a lot of 0 AC, HP mondters, or that most mondters are at 500 hp, 25+ AC
> just woke up and I'm legit interested in statistics, sry that it's confusing me a big, lul

XDD
what?
let's see, this is the distribution of CR
there is a lot at close to 0, and less and less on higher CRs
distribution of AC
there is barely any 0/close-to-0 AC creatures, and it follows more of a gauss
distribution of HP, where most creatures have low hp (knowing dnd like 1-9 hp is very common for low level creatures)
and a few creatures on high hp
from these 3 you can already tell that while HP probably scales with CR, AC does not and is more constant
if you check their respective graphs
CR to AC shows how there is a slight generic upwards trend on AC, but even low level creatures can have pretty high AC in general
CR to HP shows a very clear line where it starts off linear and goes exponential at around CR20
AC to HP
shows how higher AC allows for higher HP but it is not a certain connection
this could be figured out just by looking at the previous two but better to see directly

Cool. Everyone is illiterate by *nature*
We could still carve maps without words into stone tablets tho, right?
I think we use maps made of sticks
If i remember right
But there might be other kind of maps
Close enough
Right. That is not literacy
I assume we can count in speech
https://youtu.be/EMAKE55VOjs?si=APqmEYhrViFtBIEa
Yes
Yes, they are called stick charts. The lines represent currents or swells, shells tied to it represent islands and landmarks to look out for.
yea, it is slightly fantasy version here cus it is quite advanced looking but it works the same way :D

I might go with Sorcerer, cuz Wizard sounds like a hassle now that I think about it xD.
The real ones can also look kinda funky

But yes that is a bit more complex xD. Are they similar in principle?
Wait no those are maps stacked on eachother.
Akkor nem mondtam semmit, az igaziak extr�mebbek xD
The Isles are frequently changing around, so it has to be movable XD
Makes sense
Mi�rt nem csin�lod meg �gy spelljeid?
Hany spell-je van egy �tlag wizard-nek?
Lesznek ilyen karik�k az �v�n vagy a k�peny�n �s minden spell egy k�l�n jel botokb�l
Sok
Mert szerintem el�g sok ilyen geometrikus valamit k�ne fell�gatni r�
Amik elt�rhetnek
No, i mean mindegyik egy karika
Nono that's not the issue
You can still change, m�g nem kezd�d�tt el a kamp�ny xD *look at me* xDDD
The problem is that we don't have money and that there are no wizards or scrolls that I could learn from
Uhm....you can learn from the spirits
Yes. Wild magic or Aberrant
Isnt that the whole shenanigan?
But also, wearing a 100 wooden circles on you is something else too
I mean those would be like... face sized and can be stacked on eahc other
And shouldn't all of them be unique?
have you heard of chainmails?
xDDDD
I'm not sure the spirits drop spellbooks or scrolls
If all it took was a circle to do a 9th level spell
Everyone would be carrying basic circles
nononono
the circles would just help remember the spells
Honestly, carving your spells can be equialent to copying/buying spells into your spellbook
Wood is a resource and it takes time
not give the ability to cast it
the main problem with wizardry is simply: there is noone to learn from
And how would you make the circles be unique if you can't carve letters or runes into them?
like, nobody really knows wizard spells
Or are runes fair game?
Does that not count as being literate?

XDDDD OKAY THIS LOOKS AWFUL
De �rtitek, na!!
I think we're starting to overthink it xD. Runes exist, Kia'i even have tablets with sacrifical rights in runes written down.
And if you wear a thousand rings intertwined on your torso, how would you get the details of the spells from them exactly?
let's just stay with
wizards are
not really something that works with the setting
Not to mention, wood can break during combat
I get detailed memory from looking at colored mandalas I drawn
I can remember the words and such I heard when I was drawing it
xD
Okay, but if they are on top of eachother, the details are getting lost
Also wizard have exceptional minds
Especially if they are small intertwined things
Like every 1 out of 20 humans become wizards or so
but yea
no need to argue over this
wizards as locals
don't really work
simply due to how distasteful the spirits are about anything permanently noting stuff
dats a lot of wizards
did u mean like 1 out of 2000?
:D
Also ne nevessetek mert pontosan �gy fognak kin�zni a rajzaink XD
�gy fogunk kommunik�lno
And cuz you need 2 things to make wizards good. Money, and other wizards to kill or steal from. We have neither here.
you are allowed to speak
xD
Yes, and it'll still be funny
De akkor a spirit nem tudn�k azt mondani, hogy tess�k itt egy fa ami magic stickeket adi
I will have a replacement to scrolls
�s azok a stickek azzal a m�gi�val van felt�ltve
basically one use magical mementos
�s boom. Stick circles
Seee???
Ok� a backupom egy wizard lesz
but that doesn't mean there are wizard spells laying around
xD
Yeah but you cant also just find scrolls everywhere
Even if you buy them they can be expenso
most campaigns feature 1-2 enemy wizards
to get full books
of like 30+ spells
each
this does not
Cant the undead have those?
Not with a sorcerer in the party xD
Yes
it doesn't matter boyos
backup is faar
xD
/jk
Yeah
I want at least 3 sessions before tpk
Team comp-wise, we'll be alright
ye
perfectly good team
Yes bc im a ker�k
Anything else is just us being stupid or unlucky with rolls
Yall can go melee while i walk around and buff you
Neat
Bc oh boy i wont run XDDD
Can't wait to supersonic sucker punch my enemies' jaws off
With my tiny crab
<@282869456664002581> btw with that, how much chance do I have to survive? XD
What if i lose my cane??
We'll also have a paladin
So Eszter can get you up from the floor
Vagy ak�r Dani is, ha fel tud/szeretne venni heal spell-eket
have you heard of sticks
xD
But thats my special cane. The water gave it to me
well that sucks
xD
Nem tudom, lehet Anna tud r�la, de ha nem, im�dom hogy a dudu sz�ba se j�tt xDDDD
Most m�r nem is fog, i just find it super funny xD
Sorcererrel nem fog
MOST AKKOR TE MI VAGYY???
Egy WIS castert v�lasztott�l egy WIS caster mell�, so i changed class
Rug� leszek
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME???
No
XD
she has ptsd from the bucco - juno
<:point:951578243415302235>
oooh
De
Az k�t k�l�n klassz
ott is az volt
Vagy az itemek miatt?
True, b�r amikor a dudu subclass setup az, hogy melee bubor�k harcos, akkor nem felt�tlen�l a heal az ami eszembe jut
Ah
I see, you're a rogue now
Double dipping main party roles, and she doesn't want skillcheck rivalry.
De a karakter legal�bb ugyan �gy n�z ki?
De m�r megint nem sz�l
ehm
close enough
you'll see
Csak mert akkor nem �rom meg a backstorym
J� kor�n meg�rta, hogy dudu lesz
Mert tudok m�st is csin�lni, f�leg hogy utols�k�nt csatlakoztam
Csak a class v�ltozott, semmi m�s
De nem azt
Hanem, hogy zavarja az overlap?
Azt m�g �gyis �t tudj�tok besz�lni
Nem kell v�ltoztatnod, a rogue amugyis jobban illik a karakteremhez
Igen. Csak �n �gy fogtam fel hogy a klassz legyen m�s xd
I'm super fine with the change
You sure?
Yes yes
Sokkal jobban illik a rug� Kuwe'ihez
Ok�
Akkor fu
Maradok az �regember
Best class. Physically crippled old mam
Like... annyira nagyon jobban illik a rug� hogy nem is tudtam volna hogyan �rom meg duduk�nt
Wow xD
XDDDD
xD
OOOH HE PACKIN'!
He packin spells
For DAYYYSSS
XDDD
Nekem m�g k�ne olvasnom a PHB-b�l, mert nem igaz�n van m�g backstory. Nem mintha nagyon extr�ra akarn�m
Im sorry i cant get over this
Looks like two oversized balls
Ez m�g mindig csak egy Palia szerver, nem kell t�lgondolni
Same thought
�n mikor gondoltam t�l?
A backstory-t
*side eye*
A backstory-t
*bombastic side eye*
Can you tell me a backstory I've written that was so extra and so important?
n�lam biztos nem, t�bbir�l nem tudok xD
*CRIMINAL OFFENSIVE SIDE EYE*
He's side-eyeing you cuz he doesn't have an answer
�n t�nyleg nem eml�kszem, ha volt olyan
Am�gy extr�m alatt arra gondolok, hogy deep
Az a kamp�ny folyam�n j�tt mindig el�
A backstory maga ilyen: They had stuff happening to them and then here they are
*I don't know. It's not like anyone asks, I'm just gonna take a nap*
Kidnapping?
*I'm taking that nap by force*
<:gun2:1024086014244954204> nap
Sz�val am�gy <@332925665424834560> mit mond? XDD
*Egyel�re vel�nk m�g nem is besz�lt mert � is ut�l minket <:angycat:817122720227524628> *
Azaz
Am�gy csak annyit tudok, hogy egy paladint hoz
Dino
Dinodin
Oh ye, it is one of those
Paladino

We already have a Jesus
And he is *fishe*

https://tenor.com/view/mantis-shrimp-fishballerz-sloppypencil-2d-gif-3995753284415947128
I really like those little rings around its *neck*
Id put a ring around your neck
UwU
*Me too*
*I would just be hanging around*
*Cool, unbothered*
*I'm still a bit sad at the loss of all those arms*
*Imagine those with the monk subclass that has astral ones too*

??
*This is what peak monk form looks like*
Mant-i have two pairs of arms. The bonk/spear and one pair of regular arms
*Instead of having all those of a real mantis shrimp*
Oh
Eredetileg valahogy �gy volt le�rva a k�nyvbe, csak megint nem besz�ltek az artist-okkal

Wha??
Supersonic heating strikes
Arent you a fighter?
I am
It's a mantis shrimp/mant-i feature
It strikes so fast, the water and air around its bonkers heat up
Interesting dream
*It's not a dream. It is already reality in motion*
*I will not be pleased until her prosthetic arms also work as a practical shield*
Hah, *fire*, hoe cute
I'll be dealing *braindamage*
Yall ain't ready for my bullshit xD
*Another psychic. How original* XD
Oh? No i'll melt your brains with my stories
Unless you just plan on stabbing people in the brain
:)
Nice
Can't wait
You will be my character's bedtime story teller
*Not that kind of stories*

Csak k�v�ncsi voltam mit mondasz a csapatra.
*Na az biztos*
XDDD
�n egy rogue-ot hozok, native manaki
Azokat szeress�k
Nekem egy Kia'i sorcerer-em lesz. Aberrant vagy Wild magic, az m�g eld�l \:D
Wizard lett volna, de a setting nerfeli �ket
Manti fighter champion ami f�k�nt bonk-ra �p�t
Reg� meg egy "technically native" special snowflake kelt�t (cleric) hoz
*kereket
Kelta ker�k, kalap, nekem mindegy
*Ker�kbe t�rt v�n szatyor*
Klumpa
*Viszi mag�n a korm�nykereket. Azzal gurul*
Guys, i loooveee the quirks/flaws/bonds i gave my character xD


ASSZONGYA KELTA XDDDDDD
I wanted the mant-i to be half and half and then I realised that I could've made them a half bonker-half spearer too
there will be soooo much character growth here you guys can't even imagine :3
XD So you mean trauma
https://tenor.com/view/spongebob-spongebob-meme-trauma-imagination-spongebob-gif-23778560
I do actually mean character growth XD
might come with trauma
Oh, that's cool
we shall see
cus it is on the player ofc
Could that be done without it being homebrew and op?
Cause if not, I'll just stick to the base bonker
I don't even know what you mean there
xD
Az �tletem az volt, hogy ugye a r�kom fele-fele lenne (both male and female), ez ugye k�v�l sz�nez�sre meg egy�b kis reszletekben nyilv�nulna meg, de azt�n belegondoltam, hogy lehetne-e double down-olni a fele-fel�be �gy, hogy a boxol� �s a szigonyos subrace-t kinda �sszevegy�tem
De ja, az val�sz�n�leg homebrew-nak sz�m�tana, a m�sik meg hogy t�l sokat tudna
M�rmint t�l sok base feature-je lenne ha mindkett�vel rendelkezne
Or the flipside would be that they'd get mixed features that equals to one subrace's, and then they will be useless
a basher �s a piercer k�z�tt csak a bludgeoning / piercing dmg a k�l�nbs�g no?
I don't remember
I'll check on it
Seems like it, ye
May I?
sure xD
K�szi
I still need to choose a background
choose me
*You are now the background*
*I frickin love a good character growth*

And since you're a chimera you always have a battle buddy with you xD
Exactly. *But you guys can be my honorary battle buddies too*
*Now I can solo the entire campaign*
*I will make Old Shell proud*
bet you will bud
bet you will
*Gets annihilated by the first spell with a mental saving throw*
If we find a giant seashell, I call dibs
*As someone who reached the peak of all evolution, the only place I can go is to become each and every type of crab, and I'll need that shell for my hermit crab aspect*
*I can imagine the physical imbalance. Wobble wobble XD*

I'll actually implement that

Okay, but generally you have bigger muscles everywhere

You get shot in the head instead of the tail

Egy nagyobb dupla-t�rzses kenu fut be a Westguard-i vil�g�t� toronyhoz egy j� 20 f�vel a fed�lzeten. Egy elkezdenek kipakolni j�p�r tonna k�l�nb�z� tart�s �teleket, �p�t�anyagokat, �s felszerel�st amit a kis szigeten nem lehetne m�shogy beszerezni. Ahogy pakolnak a kapit�ny v�lt p�r sz�t Skree-vel, a vil�g�t�tornyot szolg�l� id�s t�rp h�lggyel. Halv�n, hogy Makolfba tartanak a Gathering Fesztiv�lra egy id�s �riember felk�redzkedik a haj�ra, s mivel van hely probl�ma n�lk�l fel is engedik. Ahol letelepszik az egyik �res helyen, egy fiatal Manaki mellett.
This is about the two major lighthouses: Westguard and Eastguard, this info is pretty well known
Eastguard
*The young Manaki welcomes the gentleman with a curious side-eye. His gaze, white and bright, examines the person next to him thoroughly, nodding as a gesture of greeting.*
(Most akkor angol vagy magyar? Xd vagy te angolul fogod �rni?)

*As the canoe glides in and gets ashore, the old man is already waiting for them, standing in the sand, barefeet, wearing a pair of short, white linen pants and a feathered korowai over his shoulders. Around his waist there is a kapa patterened with white, red and blue beads, a Koru symbol out of green stone hanging in his neck. 
His posture is bent over supported with a hand crafted cane that serves as a third leg for his weak stance. 
Despite his old appearance his pink skin is smooth and his built is quite robust, with strong arms and broad shoulders, yet he feels fregile and frail. His furry and slender tail gives him extra security over the deep and runny sand. 
He looks nothing like a native unless his grey hair can make up for it. However, under his goatee there is a visible tattoo running down his neck, similar to an islander. 
Upon the boats arrival he starts taking his careful steps towards the newcomers to greet them. His smile is joyful and genuine, flashing his one gold fang to the others. As he steps on the boat and sits down, a sigh of relife escapes him and gently taps the bottom of the boat.*

epicen ingyenes lesz
is noice
( Can Skree bring his stuff to the boat for him?)
� Interesting limb you got there.
*The Manaki nods his head to the elder's tail he's dragging behind himself. He crosses his arms in front of his chest as he rests his gaze on the tail for long seconds, tilting his head as he raises his eyebrows.*
� Who are you?
*The guy looks like a true Manaki, an islander, except his eyes that are whiter than seafoam, glowing like the moon on a clear midnight sky. A weird sense of superiority radiates from his body language, however, he's curious and down-to-earth.*
*The old man smirks and humms with closed as if he expected the young man's question.* -I have waited more then 30 years to hear this question again. I know my appearance is nothing that you have seen before, but dont worry, I am just as of the spirits as you are. *His blue eyes look at the Manaki and smiles at him.* -I'm Papa Kaitiaki.
-Its my pleasure to meet you. *He has an audible accent to his aged voice but his pronounciation is good.*
-Tena koe, younh one.
(Player error: what does tena koe mean? XD)
(Skree is like twice your age xD another younger folk will do it :D)
(Its a greeting)
(It's in Common, right?)
Don't have to
(Well, i assume it's Common xD)
That's a different lil silicone cup xD
(I mean not much else could it be xd

Ann�nak i guess xd
� Greetings, Papa!
*The Manaki greets him back, giving him a smirk.*
� My name is Kuwe'i, a pleasure to meet you too.
*He continues as he shifts a little in his seat to better face the grandpa.*
� You have an interesting accent, are you an outsider?
*Kuwe'i seems genuinely interested, and he cares little if his question was too direct and rude or not. His posture however tells he's ready and more than capable of protecting the elder in case he would collapse from a bigger wave crashing against the boat.*
Iv�sn�l ugye M�rk k�rdezte hogy p�ntek m�k�dhet-e. Amire mondtam hogy igen mert ha bemegyek 6ra akkor olyan 4-5 k�r�lre be tudok menni vp-be felt�ve hogy nem megyek haza. De t�bb nem r�mlik
Szerintem ezt �gy vette hogy akkor j� mindenkinek aki ott volt
Mert mindenki r�b�lintott :DD
Vagy legal�bb mondta hogy "j�l hangzik"
(He is sitting tho)
(Yes)
-Oh, and here I thought I've been here enough to not be noticable. *He chuckles, amused by the keenness of the young Manaki.* -Although, I have never heard of someone like me amongst the natives here, so I suppose that just makes ig obvious. *He looks at the lighthouse with fondness.*
yeah
�n �gy vettem, hogy p�ntek megfelel mindenmkinek so p�nteken lesz
<@463641084971712514> k�rd�sedre v�laszt adva nekem mindegy
�gy n�z ki hogy nem lesz munk�m, so r��rek szinte b�rmikor
Ah
Alrighty
*Just as a teenage Manaki boy hands Papa the rest of his equipment in a well packed bag, looking quite anxious about all the people around before quickly scurring off right before the captain announces:*
- Alright ladies, we are heading out. If the weather stays this good we might be at Makolf by next morning! Kuwe'i could land your eyes for a moment to you set us on the right way?
(Reg� you can make the seafering roll just to see in generall how well the journey goes, it is a 1d20+2 for good weather +1 for proper crew and +1 for well supplied ship, so 1d20+4 in total)
-r 1d20+4
(Okay)
I did it
I know I'll wait for the gamer girl named Nika
you guys can continue rp-ing even if I don't respond as it is not immediate, just for the journey

�s akkor nem is akarjuk �ttenni k�vi p�ntekre, hogy �gi is tudjon j�nni?
�n benne vagyok hogy �trakjuk
Mert tudom hogy sz�vesen j�tszan�
<@377469395007438849>
nekem mindegy

vannak �tleteim
�s nem sok id� �sszerakni egy karaktert
So boys?
Whats the verdict?
Hmm
�n sz�vesen hangout-oln�k holnap is
Meg j�v� h�t p�nteken is
Most ha belef�r Daninak a 2 akkor legyen az
(Most n�zegettem a napt�rat �s lehet a k�vire nem fogok tudni menni)
�n nyitott vagyok r�
akkor holnara k�sz�ljek �gy hogy game-el�nk?
Hogyha �gi is szeretne j�tszani, akkor k�vi h�ten legyen a oneshot
N�ztem
�s lehet hogy kedden ak�r mehetne egy
De akkor se tudn�k tov�bb maradni mint 8 xd
Sz�val 4-5 k�z�tti kezd�s k�ne
(Csak sima navigation check? Vagy hogy is megy? Megy r� stat modifier? Aaaaaaaa)
Akkor k�sz�lj�nk �gy hogy lesz 2 j�t�k
Azt mindenki fog tudni kockulni egy kicsit
# Navigation Check
1d20 + int with the following modifiers:
Points:
+1 for having Survival prof
+1 for having Navigators prof
+1 for having a map
+1 for seeing the stars

If you have:
0 points: disadvantage on the roll
1 point: normal roll
2 points: normal roll with proficiency
3 points: advantage roll with proficiency
(ezt m�g p�rszor fogjuk haszn�lni sz�val ki�rtam ide: https://discord.com/channels/562373378967732226/1320006532833873951/1339676200917930014)

(So 1d20 adv +prof +int?)
( <@282869456664002581> )
(yes :D and the captain even has a map but in the end it wasn't even needed)
-r 1d20 adv+3
(Nemsok� �rom a reagot)

(oh god everyone is going to call him Papa, FHUUUUCK XD)
Kedd az probs jobb

<:UwU:959931778905276456>
� Sure thing!
*Kuwe'i replies to the call for help, but continues the conversation with Papa.*
� So if you're not native, then where are you from?
*As he stands to glance at the sea, the wind blows into his shoulder-lenght hair, the two rare-colored feathers clawing into his hair firmly no matter how much the air is tearing it.*

*The tiefling chuckles at the funny assumption.* -Well, it certainly becomes a different world after a while. It can really change your perspective of the world, if you ask me. Honestly, I think the young shall experience the eye-opening effects  of solitude and aloneness.
-Though one must reach a certain age to really appreciate the benefits of it. *He says insightfully.*

� But Papa must have gotten to the Lighthouse from somewhere else, unless he really was born there.
*The guy shurgs, but continues an eyeroll later - as though he's mocking the elderly in his head.*
� You've spent your entire life in an empty Lighthouse, alone for years? How can one live without one's family and community? Isn't it boring after a while?
-Oh I wasn't completely alone. See, I had good old Skree and the spirits as company. And after a while, an occasional boat ride to the Glowing Caves really does good to the spirit. *He nods sagely and looks at Kuwe'i to see if his answer satisfied him or not.*
� Huh. Okay, so you weren't completely alone. But were you born there? Like... really?
*He asks leaning in a little, like he really wants to understand the situation.*
� I mean, yeah people can have weird birth places and conditions...
*He smirks at his statement.*
� ...but in a Lighthouse? How? What was your mother doing there?
*He just keeps humbly smiling, and sighs deeply.* -Ooh, these younglings. Tumbling in their own words and thoughts.
(XDDDDD)
(i can see they are going to get along fine)
(It's gonna be amazing xD)
� I'm you know Pops that it's usually the weirdest stories that are the best.
*Kuwe'i straightens his back and adopts a small smile as he looks out at the sea to help the navigation.*
� I was born at midnight under the starry sky. I don't have birthdays. I have birthnights.
( <@282869456664002581>  what do i know kids like him?)
(huh?)
(I don't get the question sry xD)
(whats the known superstition of people who born under a starry night?)
(or is there anything on it?)
(not really, probably quite normal since lot of people spend like a third of their lives on a boat or smth xD)
(nincs ennek valami k�l�nleges neve? isnt it special or something?)
(uhm... I don't think so?)
(okay, i was just curious)
(cuz i know he is a special snowflake)
( :) )
*Kaitiaki keeps silent and listens to the boy who moved past guessing his origin and birth circumstances.* -Ah so I see. How are those going? Which tribe do you call your own, young Manaki?
� Me and my entire bloodline lives and lived in Makolf. I'm one of the best scouts the village has.
*He proudly sticks his chest just a little bit out, his upper body's mucles tensing to appear bigger and stronger.*
� I'm also a favourite among people who are looking for escorts. I notice things others might not.
( :) )
*He does his one eyed smile again.* -For example? Surely this much keenness and intuition makes you quiet popular and reliable. But I wish to see it for myself. What do you see?
(gondolom a szemei nem mindennapoasak
(Nop, he has glowy white eyes, clearly magical. His pupil is also white, if it can be seen by his irises' glow in the first place)

*Kuwe'i chuckles as he turns to face the grandpa again.*
� Of course I'm popular, especially among the Makolf ladies. And some men as well, as I've noticed.
*He shakes his head with a grin.*
� Buut! That's not how my vision works, Papa. The spirits warn me when *necessary.* Okay sometimes they show themselves, but they're quite shy.
*He leans agains the boat's wall, resting an elbow on the edge.*
� There was one time they warned me of a falling tree. The tree would've crushed a girl to death, but I managed to save her in the last moment. The tree otherwise had no signs of falling, only when it'd have already been too late.
*Kuwe'i rests his glowy gaze on Kaitiaki with confidence, allowing him to better examine the sight if he wishes.*

(Cant wait to see if we are going to have another yria in this campaign just so endre can ruin nika again with the shenanigans)
(This time it's up to Endre xD Kuwe'i's 100% neutral to that girl he saved xDDD)
(IMAGINE, Kuwe'i falling for an outsider)
( <:zorablush:1021403403768844308> )
*Kaitiaki listens to Kuwe'i with a contant smile on his face, while he rests his hands on his cane in front of him. He seems more then pleased with the story the boy is reciting with pride. Finally, he takes a longer glance at the boy's eyes and admits hoe extraordinary he is.* -I have never seen someone with eyes quite like yours. Although I wouldnt say I have seen many of the natives in the last two decades other then Skree. *A soft chuckle escapes him and lightly taps the bottom of the canoe with his cane.* -Oh, how i would give my eye to be able to freely speak to the spirits.
-You are privilaged, I hope you know that. Having such a strong connection to them is nothing many people can call to their own.

(nop, Kuwe'i is an extraordinary hoe now)

� I know Pops, I know. I'm the beacon of hope for my people.
*Kuwe'i smirks proudly as he fixes his eyes on the sea again, providing guidance for the crew. He points towards the direction he thinks they need to go, then turns back to the grandpa. Even as he's standing, he's not really taller than Pops, if he's taller in the first place.*
� And oh I know, I'm sure the future has something great for me to get! Something even more extraordinary! I will become a legend the future generation will sing day and night!
(*Yiiisssss* :3333)
(good question, it's always hard to tell ahead of time)

(he? Nah never)
(Fuck around and find out why :333)
(Am�gy papa szerintem rendesen kiegyenesedve olyan 174???)
(I need him to be tall xd. He is just rokkant)
(Looooool okay akkor Kuwe'i 15cm-vel alacsonyabb xDDDDDD)
-Oh, is that so? Why, how the ambitious will take over the world? *Before letting him think of an answer, he continues.* -If you listen to an old crippled man's advice, who might not be native but been here longer then you...Ambition is a great driving force, yet one must never sail too far from the shore. You might meet waves you cant weather. *He squints and turns his head to the sun.*
-You are still young. First, learning how to peddal bavkwards is important.
(Legyen alacsonyabb? That sounds kinda a lot(
(Nooo teljesen j� papa magass�ga)

� How does one learn if we never see what's over the horizon? Sure, it's safe to stay where we're familiar with our surroundings, but that will never result in new legends to pass down on the generations.
*The guys nods ambitiously as he gazes into the distance.*
� I will bring a new era, just you see! You're not allowed to die until you see me soar above the seas and islands as the protector of this place!
Adn�m xD

I could be caught with a net. I was caught in a net once
It was some old guy who wanted to force me to call him papa
(OH MY FUCKING HE IS BLIIIIND)
*The old tiefling smiles at the childis certainty of Kuwe'i and see how his words did not entirely got to his head, he just lets him be.* -I hope you achieve your dreams but be catious. Not everyone and everything can be simple.
*looks around anxiously)
� Sure, of course Pops, I'm cautious enough already.
*He replies absent-mindedly. Then, he glances at Kaitiaki's cane, and then at the tiefling.*
� Did you achieve something big? I mean, you must have achieved *something*, you must be speaking of experience, am I right?
Meet you on the festival
*A longer pause follows as the old man porecces the question with a subtle smile. A faint sparkle of pain runs over his iris.* -That is true. I dont know about big. What do you think? I see you looking at my walking stick.
(Bitch)
(He needs a whoopin)
(XD)
(*starts materializing rocks above the boat*)
(like this?)
Meet you in the sea crab boil
� You don't know about big? How old are you, Pops?
*He answers the question with another.*
� Do you even need a walking stick by the way? You seem well built and strong, and you don't know about big?
*Kuwe'i smirks again.*
� Why not go and do something big? You don't want kids and later generations talking about your legend?
*Kir�gom a kripli l�b�t a pappernak* XD

It was a bossfight as well some 3x3 sized creature
In a cathedral like hall
o.o
Drakenheim moment?
*Lehet. Megengedem* XD
Haha I wouldn't know, didn't play in Draken
*Papa cant help but laugh at the barrage of personal questions from the excitable islander and slaps his knee.* -Im afraid that its far too late for me for that. Im very well satisfied with the life I got from the spirits. I have found myself whole within their care, even if Im not on the same terms as you are with them. 
-About the walking stick. I very much need it, sadly. I had an accident.
*Papa's answer shuts the young Manaki up for a good few seconds. As he takes a moment to reflect on his previous words, he shouts a "that way!" for the crew as navigation, then, he clears his throat before laying his eyes on the tiefling again.*
� So... can I ask what happened?
(he kneeled too much)
(That'd be sad xD)
-A life long reminder from the spirits.
� An accident that the spirits punish for? They must have gotten really upset.
*Kuwe'i sits back down next to Papa, fidgeting with the beads wrapped around his bicep and twirling his lip piercing with his tongue.*
� But I assume you don't wish to talk about it. I can understand, everyone has an element in their past they don't like to uncover.
*The captain chirps in.*
- Well said Kuwe'i, trust me you wouldn't want to hear half of these peoplevs stories.
(Lol i love the captain xD)
(I dunno if he said it like... jokingly or seriously tho)
(Cuz this sounds like he knows a few embarrassing pasts xD)
Hows the team lookin for Monday? Cause I might actually need to skip xd
Since they took my tuesday resting day and put it elsewhere I just have too much to do this Monday :c
*tho I'd actually be free on Wednesday if that'd work for others*
https://youtu.be/CAMWdvo71ls?si=M07X44SnSOFRd8Hu
Monday is so far good for everyone (else)
Wednesday is session 0 for Sunken
-Sometimes it is just better to move on and accept how things are. Plus, there has to be a story for another time appropriate. I would rather hear more about you and your ambitiouns. Who know, maybe you pour some life into me and I learn how to walk without the cane. *He laughs it off and waves his hand dismissivly.*
(Am�gy itt mindig meleg van?)
(Ez ilyen tr�pusi �ghajlat� j�t�k lesz?)

Oh god. I guess i just cut every connection i have with him
So i wont ever have a chance to dee it
*see
� Did anybody try healing? Or is it something that needs stronger magic?
*Kuwe'i asks with arm muscles tense, as if he was almost about to move.*
� Maybe I could try making arrangements for you in Makolf? Or something?
oh yea, powerlevels just so you know:
you will be basically the strongest people in Makolf as 1st level characters, Manaki people are generally not strong, some few Ikolf do have good combat power
MireScales have a few good hunters
Kia'i are a step up with their reefguards
Decapodians are quite militaristic

on magic availability:
Manaki mostly do stuff with rituals not straight up spellcasting but they can get a LOT done with them
Ikolf similarly ritual based but you can find 1st/2nd level spells on them sometimes (mostly Cleric spells)
Mirescales similarly to Ikolf but with Druid spells
Kia'i have some higher level Druids
Decapodians have basically no spellcasting in general
Basic ass crabs
wait until one bitchslaps u
Says the cripple
Runesmith already spoiled their CR and yeah nah. They are stronk
the decapodian commander has the decapodian guard statblock because that is also strong enough to go for a commander
But they are the best fighters

(Yes)

(oh, well, it needs a regenerate)

(It comes with the native manaki bg :D)
(Ooooh i see)
� Well, if you happen to change your mind...
*Kuwe'i shrugs.*
� I don't know, I wouldn't want to atone for an entire life. But we're all different.
*He relaxes himself while keeping an eye on the sea. The Manaki then sighs as he changes subject.*
� So what made you leave your Lighthouse nest?

Great, now you have to design a soul-permeable dyson sphere.

(survey link in case someone wants to contribute: <https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/AODTUW>)
(and on the survey before you go "ewww I'm not" consider that commonly things like *vampires or elves count as monster fucking too*)
https://youtube.com/shorts/oGuwO_7_ZM8?si=f5Oxb7E8d0g6E_So
I wouldn't count elves monsters, unless they act like the fey and look like the night elves from Warcraft XD
I agree personally but "public" perception is different
public as in like the 10% of the world who knows what elves are

-Well, you know there is a festival about to happen. It was due time for me to finally go out and socalise again. I have earned it. Is this your first festival?
(it is a yearly festival ever since Skomm Fylkir was defeated, and basically anyone who isn't too young or too old to travel visits it)
(Oh)
(Rewrote it)
(Nika feel free to make up a few things about it, but the main event is a story told over several days by the eldest storytellers of Manaki, as well as presentations of power through rituals)

� Naturally, my favourite part is the food they got there. Sometimes I also even participate in the memory test they host for the kids, because the prize there is rare, free sweets.
*Kuwe'i grins.*
� Ya know, they ask questions about the story they tell throughout the day. The kids with the best memories win tasty snacks. Too bad I often get kicked out, labeling my age and mental capacity as unfair advantage.

I love how the hre area is just the hre
It was shortened from orc badasslands because at the time the map was made, the  map maker's homeland was at war with the orc empire.

Rituals 101:
Ancient Rituals can be performed by any character.
Instead of spell ranks they have character level requirements.
Each ritual has a maledicto that is some kind of drawback or side effect that is unavoidable. This means if a side effect would be "take 5 damage", nothing, no magic or anything can stop you from taking that 5 damage to your hitpoints. Of course you can heal it after the fact.
Outside of these they follow the general idea of how spells work
<@&1320006468707029063> 
Yall know the following ritual now, however it is worth mentioning that this ritual is only meant to be used during the Gathering Festival, and is looked at weirdly when used outside of the first morning of the festival. There is no known case of anyone doing that though.

# Antiqua lux
*Ancient Ritual, Evocation and Divination*
**Level Requirement:** 1
**Casting Time:** 1 hour
**Range:** 5 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Lasts 3 days

You call upon the spirit of your ancestors to join you in the Gathering Festival. They will take a spiritual form of a mote of light gently floating above the area you summoned them. The first time you hit 0 hit points in the light of these motes you instantly stabilize.

***Maledicto.*** Your ancestors exhaust their power by keeping you safe. If you benefit from the stabilization effect of this ritual the mote disappears and cannot be summoned again for 1 year.
(this mostly exists so you guys see how rituals will look like :D)

oh, I know I know!
xD
Just curious bc idk how secretive or mysterious he feels like xd
dw the rest of the rituals are not like this xd
not really tbh
at least not for me
but that is alright
he is an old guy and obviously he won't tell his life story to strangers
Yeah thats why im curious if the other have any connections to make or points to rais
Fair
I either don't know enough lore to guess, or i'm just stupid xD
I mean you can still guess
My guesses wouln't be even close then xD
it is just way too early to know tbh xD
Yeeee
But thats why its gooood. Its fun
And honesty i don't even wanna rush it
We'll know when we'll know
Alright
Fair
I was about to say something about kuwei

That's the charm :3
Na
Mondja xD
Rumors are always fun
THATS WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING THE WHOLE TIME XXDD
XDDDD
I think he is an immortal
Ok� de a Papa nem besz�lt eleget hogy pletyk�lni lehessen r�la xDDD
Oh wow that's a nice guess xDDD
I mean that just makes more room to speculate and rumor about
To come up with something juicy :Pp
you need *some* basis to make rumors, but dw, just let it happen naturally
don't force it
Sure
Nekem megfordult a fejemben hogy Papa csak egy �jabb reincarnationje Trouble-nek
XD HONESTLY
xD
XDDD
Omg this is too funny because i completrly forgot about that XDDD
*But now that we mentioned it*
XDDDD
De na ilyen out of game guesding szerintem nem �rt
De persze ha az emberek nem szeretik nem kell
Csak j� a j�t�kr�l besz�lgetni ^^
I mean, what are your theories of Eszter's character then? :D
She is always making wrong bets
And probably got pushed out of her tribe or smth
wonder where that guess is coming from xdddd

cus MireScales, change their names on a whim

U somehow always manage to play the basic bitch no matter how specialsnowflake you wanna be xDDDD
I mean weve read each others backstory. I dont think his basic. Hes got some....depth to him BADMTSS
but nah, I think fishjesus is pretty high up on the special scale
Yeah fishiboi is one of the specialestest
I think Chttdrr is the most basic
They just...walked out of the ocean and

XD
Sorry
Fucking purple pp
It's alright xD
My fault
Imade him purple
Im the new purple now
But I that as they give you the tattoo after you beat them, so the victorious wear them. <@282869456664002581> may you clarify the wording for us?
being bested means someone beat your ass
Someone was better than you
Yes. But don't they give away the tattoo's after they are bested, rather than put it on their body?
Am I reading it wrong?
I think you are
They are compensating after they lose a fight, and for lack of armor
Because as long as you don't lose, you are the best, and why change perfection?
In crab society losers and those physically lacking get tattoes
It seems
At least based on this description
Or you know how to create a specific tattoo, but you're not going to give it away to the weak ones. If they beat you, as a reward you can gift them more power?
Mostly, I guess there are some who just want one because art
Yeah, now that I re-read it for like the fifth time
It kinda does have weird phrasing
Is the second part detached from the first?
Yeah. I can see how you'd read it that way. "Apply" helyett "gift" vagy valami megoldotta volna ha az �n �rtelmez�sem az amit szerettek volna.
Val�sz�n�leg
Imma just edit my reag
� Mi emberek m�shogy m�k�d�nk, nek�nk nincs p�nc�lunk amit gyeng�tene egy piercing. A csata k�zbeni f�jdalom is f�jdalom, de szerencs�re viszonylag b�k�s a k�rny�k.
*Kuwe'i ism�t a v�zbe m�rtja a kez�t, majd belet�r nedves ujjaival a haj�ba.*
� De nem, t�lem nem loptak a kal�zok. Huszon�t �vvel ezel�tt, a kal�zok elraboltak egy terhes n�t n�h�ny falusival egy�tt, kincseket k�vetelve �rte �s a t�bbi ember�rt cser�be. A n� �s a benne fejl�d� gyermek, tov�bb� a t�bbi falulak� majdnem soha nem t�rtek vissza. Mire megtal�lt�k �s megmentett�k a n�t �s a t�bbi falusit, addigra a n� megsz�lte a gyermek�t az �jszaka folyam�n a kal�zok �ltal teremtett embertelen k�r�lm�nyek k�z�tt.
*A Manaki egy hitetlenked� vigyorral megr�zza a fej�t.*
� Lehet a gyermek most nem lenne olyan �ldott ha a sz�l�faluj�ban sz�letett volna, mint most, de az emberrabl�s akkor is emberrabl�s, �s a gyermek nem hajland� �letben hagyni egyetlen kal�zt sem, mert mind ugyan�gy megism�teln�k mindazt, amit az el�deik tettek. A gyermek nem hajland� hagyni, ugyanaz megt�rt�njen m�sok �desanyj�val, mint az �v�vel.
- �sszefoghattn�ttokk. *Feleli na�van. Nem fogja fel, hogy Kuwe'i mag�r�l besz�l e/3-ban*
- Bizttos jobban menne. �n is csattlakkozn�kk. Nekkem bentt van a h�som. Ha f�j, akkkkor, vagy megvakkulokk, vagy m�rr meghalokk, de addig fel ttudom sz�rni, sz�tt ttudom tt�rni a k�ls� h�sosokat akkad�ly n�lkk�l.
\- Hihetetlen vagy.
*Motyogja �rzelemmentes arccal Kuwe'i, m�ly ment�lis szenved�st rejtegetve semleges maszkja m�g�tt.*
- Bennem nem kkell hinni. Itttt vagyokk. *Sz�tt�rja k�t "oll�j�t", m�sik k�t kez�vel pedig v�gig mutat mag�n.*
- Ez egy dics� feladatt, ez�rrtt seg�ttekk, csakk sz�lj amikkor menni kkell.

(Maybe fish Jesus, just an old guyTM or dino pirate could give you better mental support XD)
*Turns out Papi is a commoner with an extra cantrip and a total of 2 HP*
Wouldn't be surprised. He's just unnaturally lucky
Except when he has to count money
But hey, nobody's perfect
Otherwise he'd be too powerful XD
XDDD
�n is legyek combatra?
Wdymmmm
Nem az�rt csatlakozt�l vissza hogy legy�l?
Vagy valamire rosszul eml�kszem �s m�r nem vagy vel�nk?
Dude yes of course xD
*N�lk�led lehet meg is halnak*
Jk ofc

:3
�n is halgat�zok majd
Nice
creep
we don't kinkshame here
Nekem holnap kor�n mel� btw sz�val ha lehet ne maradjunk majd sok�ig xd
Legal�bbis �n nem tudok sok�ig lenni ink�bb �gy mondom
Nyolcig lesz�nk vagy ameddig a combat tart ha el�bb v�ge
De ha nem tudsz nyolcig maradni, nem baj akkor befejezz�k kor�bban
Kilencig tartana a session eredetileg de valami�rt senki nem tud 9ig maradni cs�t�rt�k�nk�nt xd
*should we start Tales sessions earlier in the future?*
xD
Nah, nekem a kor�bbi kezd�s nem mindig m�k�dne
ah
nvm I guess xd

\- Ti milyen sokat besz�ltek... *Mondja a halember*
� Nem hiszem el! J�, ok�, ha megyek kal�zhaj�t raid-elni, magammal viszlek!
*Mondja Csttdrr-nek, majd Kuwe'i elr�h�gi mag�t k�nj�ban �s a kia'i-ra mutat.*
� K�rlek mondd hogy legal�bb neked leesetett a mese!
*Lassan b�lint egyet, ahogy visszafordul fel� �res fekete szemeivel.*
\- T�l�lted �ket. Most pedig a felel�ss�gtudat mellett a bossz� is vez�reln� tetteidet ha �jra kal�zokkal tal�lkozn�l.
*Fels�hajt a sr�c �s Csttdrr-hoz fordul.*
� Leegyszer�s�tem, a mese az �n any�mr�l sz�lt. Nincs itt harmadik f�l aki vel�nk j�nne kal�zokat irtani.
*CsttDrr elkezd �tsim�tani a "bajszain".*
- �. �rrttem. �s vele mi van?
� Kivel? �desany�mmal?
- Aha. Ccssakk �lettben maradtt, nem? Sz�v�snakk hangzikk.
� Persze hogy �letben maradt, most is �pp otthon van �s val�sz�n�leg szitkoz�dik amiatt ahogy kupisan otthagytam az �gyamat.
*Vonja meg a v�ll�k, de b�szk�n vigyorog anyja eml�t�s�n.*
\- K�rdezhetek? *Mondja ahogy egy p�r l�p�ssel k�zelebb l�p Kuwei-het*
- Hogyan juttottttattokk vissza?
� K�rdezhetsz.
*B�lint, k�zben Csttdrr-ra emeli a tekintet�t.*
� Apa �s p�r m�sik harcos ut�nuk ment, �s m�g id�ben megtal�lt�k mindannyiukat. Siker�lt lek�vetni�k a haj�t.
\- Egy anya mit�l lesz �des?
- Hogyha el�g gy�m�lcs�tt esznekk... Gondolom.
(WHAT IS THJISSS,?,,,,,???)
(IDEK)
� Nem... nem sz� szerint �des, az a sz� m�st is jelent. �des az anya, ha � sz�lt. Mostoha az anya, ha � csak felnevelt, de nem v�r szerinti rokonod.
*Magyar�zza a Manaki, de sz�p lassan kezdi feladni a dolgot hogy mindent megmagyar�zzon.*
Kia'i don't care about genders
Also kia'i: *sees a newborn male* **Lisan Al-Gaib!*
Gender based naming conventions XD
They turn male after their midlife crisis but keep their names
Female born kia'i? I sleep
Male born kia'i? REAL SHIT
(Akkor mi a nevel�anya? XD)
(arr�l nemtudsz)
*Oldalrabiccenti a fej�t*
\- Ti ezt k�vetitek? T�nyleg k�zelebb �lltok a delfinekhez mint hozz�nk.
- �n szerettem az anyukk�matt. Vigy�zott r�nkk am�g toj�sokk volttunkk. Ttan�ttott harrcolni.
(�gy �rtem t�rzsekn�l m�g eg�sz kommun�lis volt a gyereknevel�s)
(A parton vagyunk m�g mindig?)
(yupp)
(Yeah xD)
<@875753704685436938> bek�ld�d majd a k�sz artot?
(*R�vid vagy, Dani, de legal�bb van* XD)
H�t majd ha k�sz lesz, sure xD
(One of us. One of us)
*Kaitiaki csak enyhe mosollyal hallgatja a fiatalokat �l le�l egy kicsit arr�bb egy apr� hokedlire, botj�n t�maszkodva kiny�jtott k�zzel.* -Oh, hogy mennyit fogotok ti egym�st�l tanulni. *El�gedetten s�hajt egyet �s hunyorogva b�logat.*
-Azt hiszem, tal�n nem v�letlen, hogy mind ide lyukadtunk ki.
�gy gondoltam

*Ijedten felugrik.*
- Hol a lyukk?! Hol vagyokk lyukkas?
� A lelkek mentsenek...
*Motyogja Kuwe'i mag�nak alig hallhat� hanger�n.*
� Att�l m�g hogy egy anya mostohaanya, nem jelenti azt hogy nem lehet szeretni! Na �s mi van akkor ha valakit felnevelnek, mert el�rvult? Legal�bb lett neki valakije akit anyjak�nt szerethet.
*Felny�g k�nj�ban.*
� Besz�lj�nk m�sr�l!
\- Szerintem semmi ilyenre nem gondolt bar�tunk. De ha nem szeretn�l besz�lni r�la nem kell.
*�rtetlen�l n�z, hogy ez most honnan j�tt, �s kihez besz�l a sr�c, kit oktat.*
*Pislog�s n�lk�l n�zi tov�bbra is az embert majd lassan let�rdel, hogy szintre ker�lj�n a t�bbiekkel.*
(�n nem tudom hogy fogok tudni csendes, �reg b�lcset j�tszani �gy xd)
(*�gy, hogy csendes vagy �s �reg* XD)
(Nah)
(You can tell us cool stories with lessons, and ChttDrr will probably have fun, probably won't get most of it tho)
- Szeretted a lelkkekkett h�vogattni ahogy hallom. Szokkttakk seg�tteni olyankkor? *Fordul az �shonos fi�hoz.*

*�rtetlen b�mul�sukra a sr�c agressz�van megvonja a v�ll�t, majd a t�mav�lt�sra megk�nnyebb�lten fell�legzik.*
� Igen, rendszeresen kommunik�lok vel�k, ez�rt vagyok �n Makolf legmegb�zhat�bb felder�t�je!
*Kicsit kih�zza mag�t, kid�lleszti mellkas�t, de azonnal vissza is g�rnyed a teli gyomra miatt.*
� K�lt�ri csoportos munk�kra is rendszeresen magukkal visznek mint �rt �s kalauzt. T�bbsz�r is el�fordult hogy a lelkek seg�ts�g�vel mentettem meg embereket.
https://www.ddinstagram.com/reel/DGOvgMQSD3Z/?igsh=MTlrYm0yNjByMjcxZA==
*Az egyik gyerek sikeresen hason dobja egy kis kaviccsal pont amikor kih�zza mag�t.*
- Haha! Te vagy a dob�!
*Majd elfut valami eszm�letlen sebess�ggel elfut a part ment�n ahol p�r m�sik gyerek is futk�rozik.*

� Sa. Man. Tha!
*Tenyer�ben az apr� kavics vil�g�tani kezd, majd minden erej�t bevetve a gyerek ut�n haj�tja, term�szetesen figyelve r�, hogy lehet�leg ne okozzon k�rt a kisl�nyban.*

Tal�l is valamit, igaz nem kavics, hanem egy kis �res csigah�z, �s amikor a szemei el� emeli, kicsit mintha megakadna, majd mint aki figyelm�t vesztette elkezdi �tt�r�lgetni �s bef�zni a h�l�b�l �ll� poncs�j�nak zsin�rjai k�z�.*

It's exactly the same xD it's just the finished one is cleaner in means of lineart, and has color
Tis just how sketch vs final is sometimes
Usually the sketch feels more natural xdd

� The festival hosts a lot of people, and the activities are also fun. The whole thing makes me feel alive.

This kinda reminds me of those blackface cartoon characters from way back when
The racoon-like visage of a sagacious procyal

As the most whimsical and playful of the agathions, procyals are the most likely to be encountered on the Material Plane, teaching deep philosophical lessons and delivering wisdom through pranks and impersonations. Mischievous and playful, these raccoon-headed humanoids love to socialize with mortals and learn about their societies. Unlike their mortal counterparts, Procyals' fur starts off dark russet in color, giving way to gray and white flecks on their muzzles as they grow older. Only procyal leaders boast the stark gray and black coloration of a true raccoon. Those who recognize procyals' age and wisdom treat these creatures with great respect.

Whatever their natural appearance, procyals make excellent shapeshifters and can assume the form of any humanoid that they've encountered. They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community, often appearing as someone's trusted mentor to deliver an important message in a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They're not above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they've assumed, especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson. Raccoon agathions prefer to use a blade if forced into combat, but they're prepared to use their claws and fight dirty if necessary.

I was actually thinking about something that would be pretty fun.
Some patrons could be changed out with some of our older characters
Im not giving up my oomfie Sarevok
Sarevok-ot neh�z lenne cser�lni yesh
But Zythian and Ramius are easier
The Lantern Angel Nikita as the good patron xd
For the good patron I did think about Nikita or Therius yes. Nyx would have been fun if she would be alive.
For neutral I was thinking Alton in disguise or (I know he's dead by this point) Arden
But if you guys have other ideas do tell please
Theriusssssyyy
That would still be Zythian btw but not reall
Nyx would've been somewhere on the neutral side if she'd have survived
Trouble
KOCK
Kock nem vil�grenget� karakter, � ide nem m�k�dne. But I will keep him in mind for future patron options \:D
Nah i was just joking. But i could def see trouble here. Or as a backup? O.O
Zeuss xD
YEEEEEAAAAASSS
Isn't Trouble out of the picture since he's lvl20?

Oh yeah him too
So we need a neutral and a good patron, and one that has arcane connections and one that has a divine sect
Trouble
Why would that be an issue?
As a backup
As a patron he'd work instead of Zythean
He was lvl 20 when he was in the oneshot
He was lvl 12 when he was done with to
*toa
Yeah fair. We'll keep him in mind as well if we don't use him as patron
Ah I see

I want to be very clear about one thing with the adventure. This will put role play into ttrpg. Its a role play heavy game (by desing), so its more important to have a good charater then a good sheet. (The people who played under me probably already knows.) I'm gonna role play as much npc's as i can. If this would bother you... maybe this one is not for you.
But he did
I mean
Do we ever wanna continue tbor?
Like actually
I'd love to T-T
Cause if not then probably he'd have become a ranger/bloodhunter multi specifically honed against the mirror creatures
Forced to kill his dear corrupted friend in the process
Jaded a bit most likely
Bull could have a chance to redeem her i think :D
Taking on the sea on the back of his now much larger companion, Grape
Eyo :D
I think Bull is the only one who could redeem her, and if he does it right, he could totally can :D
Well then he'd probably try yes xD
Bull could prove her that (found)family makes her much more than just simply being powerful :3
:333
Yes DiceGod
I mean, maybe, their found family plotline trope could make me cry if done well T-T
Okay, not just maybe
XDDDDDD
I WAS NOT EXPECTING HIM TO SPEAK HUNGARIAN WTF XDDD
<@282869456664002581> YOUR BOT CAN SPEAK HUNGARIAN
I'm not sure we will continue it proper, but I could make a few session long adventure that closes the adventure
We got pretty far into that one as well
I'd love that

What about the Kings Tomb i suspect its some kind of final location for me
well you definitely didn't get anywhere close to it xD
Yes thats why i expect to face discrimination from some tribes he might have stole from
Well not yet
I don't understand, you wanna continue pirating them? or what?
xD
places you soiled kinda are places you already been to, no?
btw there isn't much separation between people
basically, the whole Isles is now in Makolf for the festival
at least human/dwarves
Oof
Well, ofc. You know those places
I mean, no but if out oath goes there
At some point
Idk what will happen. Someone might try to dwell in
And wed have to stop them or something

*He chuckles.* -No, I could see that you were having a good time there. Not to mention you found some new friends. Most peculiar of them nontheless. *He scrunches his face in an elderly manner and nods.* -The spirits are quite something, aren't they? Seen anything your eyes might find...out of the ordinary? *He asks, his words carrying mystique.*
Paths
Im trying so hard not to miscommunicate but im so braindead xd
I just finished at uni
we can talk it later
*Kuwe'i nods when his elder mentions he got new friends, but shrugs when asked if he saw anything.*
� Not really, no. Everything was in order, no spirit seemed to be disturbed.
*He smiles as he glances into the night sky.*
� Usually, the days of the festival remain all peaceful. But I will let you, and others know if there's something wrong.
*Like something just popped into his mind, the Manaki grabs the basket and pushes it to the door of their house, staying on the ground.*
� Mama, I got the firewood!
Plot twist: The museum employs ghosts as 24/7 security guards.
(They came with some haunted artifacts, and employing them was easier than finding people to perform the correct rituals to send the ghosts into their respective afterlives.)

Under the xy amount of memes
And it's not like I could look back at these deleted things because I'm not one of the two-three people who can do that
please do
a thing to mention:
- someone posting something actually campaign related and then someone making a joke on it
and
- just putting a random meme in that is someway connected to the campaign
are two
*very*
different things
Even then, we have plenty of memes and gifs here that are just out if the blue

so that was not Reg�'s joke reaction to me posting something?
But shrimp memes are out of here

But you see we don't exclusively have just campaign related stuff. Even in text, we have other convos about conpletely different campaigns
Better that way
I don't think we are arguing, just discussing
I mean, I haven't cussed out Endi or anyone, and I'm not angry, at least I don't think so
Ot's just weird
Make it make sense
I know I'm not enforcing everything 100% as that would be just
jarring and would just kill everything on the server
but making an effort to keep things clean is nice
So...
it turns out
nuclear waste
can be used to produce clean energy
the waste
itself
we have the tech since like 1950
america has enough nuclear waste to power the whole country for a good 150 years
just on the nuclear waste alone
this is not just "oh technically geothermal can power everything"
nah
you just gotta build the facility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNZ5qylG3qk
the biggest reason it isn't
is because politics decided to make it too expensive
it wouldn't even be expensive
Yeah, and that's fair, I just want a heads up if I send in something that does not belong and then I want that to not just be something that seemingly doesn't affect everyone equally then, also maybe relocating messages to shitposting or something like that rather than straight-up delete without permission

Come close, friends, for now I shall tell you of the day the tides brought new kin to our shores, the day the first Ikolf set foot upon Manaki.

The morning had barely broken when the first ships were seen upon the horizon. Great wooden beasts, their sails billowing like the wings of seabirds, carried a people unlike any the Manaki had known before. They were strong and sturdy, like the mountains, with beards as thick as the jungle canopy and laughter as hearty as the crashing waves. They had journeyed far across the endless sea, seeking a home where they could live in peace and plenty.

At first, the Manaki watched in silence, wary of these newcomers. But the Ikolf came not with weapons, but with open hands and warm smiles. We brought gifts�fruits of our land, strange grains, and salted meats, new to the tongues of the islanders. And in return, the Manaki welcomed them, sharing the bounty of the Isles, the sweet fruits and fresh fish, the warmth of their fires, and the songs of their ancestors.
As the sun rose high, a great feast was prepared. The hunters set forth, chasing the swift-footed boar and spearing the fattest fish. The fires blazed, and the scents of roasting meat and sweet bread filled the air. Side by side, Manaki and Ikolf danced, their feet drumming upon the earth, their voices rising in joyous harmony. In that moment, they became one people, bound not by blood but by friendship, by the breaking of bread and the sharing of stories.

And so, the Ikolf found their home among the Manaki. They built their halls and planted their seeds, and their children grew alongside those of the islanders. From that day forth, they were no longer strangers, no longer visitors upon foreign shores, but kin, forever woven into the song of Manaki.

So let us feast! Let us dance! Let the flames rise and the laughter echo across the land, as we remember the day our two peoples became one, bound by shared hearth and story.

*As the elderly woman finishes her tale she reaches down to the ground and from below great stone tables rise all across the open square, ready to host all the bounties of the earth and sea.*

Gather close, my friends, for now we speak not of joy, but of sorrow and redemption. Today, I tell you of the great betrayal that poisoned our land, and the courage that rose to cleanse it. This is the tale of Skati Fylkir, the dark king who sought to make the Isles his own - and the spirit of Kadaur who struck him down.

When the Ikolf first came to our shores, they were welcomed as kin, but among them walked a serpent disguised as king. Skati Fylkir, the ruler of the Ikolf, had once been a man of great promise - a leader, wise and strong. But his heart had been twisted by his thirst for power. In his pride, he sought not only to rule his people, but to conquer the very forces of life and death.

In secret, Skati delved into forbidden rituals, seeking eternal life. He turned his back on the teachings of his ancestors, choosing instead to defile the sacred land of Manaki with magic of blood and deceit. He drew strength not from the love of his people or the bounty of the land, but from the very life force of the Isles themselves. With every sacrifice, with every drop of blood spilled in his name, Skati grew in power and spirit.
|| ||
The Manaki, wise and close to the spirits of the Isles, saw through his lies. They knew the land was sickening under his rule, the spirits whispering of his treachery. But the Ikolf settlers, blinded by his silver tongue, could not see the truth. They followed him into darkness, believing his false promises of paradise.

But not all hope was lost. Kadaur, the spirit of this very land - the mountains, the rivers, the earth beneath our feet - watched in silence, waiting with the patience of stone. Until the day of his awakening.

It was on a day much like this, with the sun just breaking over the horizon, that Skati made his final mistake. He declared war upon the Manaki, seeking to bend them to his will and use their strength to fuel his twisted rituals. But in that moment, the Ikolf settlers saw the truth. They saw the cruelty that had poisoned their king�s heart, and they turned on him.

And then, Kadaur rose.

From the heart of the mountain, the great spirit manifested a champion - our great hero Kada, bearing the legendary spear Marrow. With the Manaki and Ikolf united at his side, Kada led the charge against Skati. They stormed his temple of sacrifice, the place where so many lives had been unjustly taken. His dark power rivaling all of his kin combined.

But even Skati�s sorcery was no match for the spirit of the Isles. Kada thrust his spear through Skati�s blackened heart, pinning him to the altar of his own making. The earth trembled, and Skati�s scream echoed across the Isles, but it was too late for him. His tyranny ending with his final breath.
|| ||
To this day, Skati�s cursed body remains imprisoned in that temple, bound by the warding stones placed by both Manaki and Ikolf. The land healed, the people were freed, and once more, the Isles breathed in peace.

So let us remember this tale, not just of a king�s fall, but of the unity that saved us. The spirits of Manaki, the courage of its people, and the strength of Kadaur all rose to defend this land, and they stand with us still.

*As the elder finishes her story, she lifts her hand to her heart, and gentle winds sweep across the crowd, warm silence falls upon the village and a feeling of peace and unity falls upon the people.*

Gather close, children of Manaki, and listen well, for this is the tale of how our world was born from the hands of the wandering soul, the Star Breather.

Long before the Isles knew the touch of mortal feet, before the trees whispered their secrets and the waves hummed their songs, the Star Breather roamed the vast darkness beyond the sky. It was lonely, traveling from one world to the next, for creation was its joy and to linger was its sorrow.

One day, the Star Breather found a place of nothingness, a void waiting to be filled. From its chest, it pulled a single rib, and from its heart, it let its own ichor spill like ink upon the great canvas of the empty sea. With Marrow, the sacred bone-brush, it painted the first of our lands, great islands rising from the depths, their shores kissed by the breath of the divine. The mountains, the rivers, the sky�all drawn with the strokes of its sacrifice.

And when the Star Breather was finished, it looked upon its work and saw that it was beautiful. But the land was still and silent. So it exhaled one final breath, and in that breath came the spirits�some who would roam and change, like the beasts and the people, and others who would hold steady and endure, like the stones and the tides. The mortal and the immortal, forever entwined, forever bound in the dance of life.

Thus, the cycle was set. The land gives life, and the life honors the land. Four times a year, we give back to the Isles, just as the Star Breather once gave of itself. And so we gather here today, beneath the high sun, to offer our gratitude. We honor the spirits, we honor our ancestors, and we honor the wandering soul who breathed us into being.

Let the motes of light rise. Let the spirits hear our voices. Let the Star Breather know that its children still remember.

*As the storyteller concludes his tale he reaches up to the sky and slowly grasps towards the sun, which in turn dims and then disappears from the sky, letting the stars shine and the flying motes illuminate the village in a beautiful shower of golden light.*
Come close, friends, for now I shall tell you of the day the tides brought new kin to our shores, the day the first Ikolf set foot upon Manaki.

The morning had barely broken when the first ships were seen upon the horizon. Great wooden beasts, their sails billowing like the wings of seabirds, carried a people unlike any the Manaki had known before. They were strong and sturdy, like the mountains, with beards as thick as the jungle canopy and laughter as hearty as the crashing waves. They had journeyed far across the endless sea, seeking a home where they could live in peace and plenty.

At first, the Manaki watched in silence, wary of these newcomers. But the Ikolf came not with weapons, but with open hands and warm smiles. We brought gifts�fruits of our land, strange grains, and salted meats, new to the tongues of the islanders. And in return, the Manaki welcomed them, sharing the bounty of the Isles, the sweet fruits and fresh fish, the warmth of their fires, and the songs of their ancestors.
  
As the sun rose high, a great feast was prepared. The hunters set forth, chasing the swift-footed boar and spearing the fattest fish. The fires blazed, and the scents of roasting meat and sweet bread filled the air. Side by side, Manaki and Ikolf danced, their feet drumming upon the earth, their voices rising in joyous harmony. In that moment, they became one people, bound not by blood but by friendship, by the breaking of bread and the sharing of stories.

And so, the Ikolf found their home among the Manaki. They built their halls and planted their seeds, and their children grew alongside those of the islanders. From that day forth, they were no longer strangers, no longer visitors upon foreign shores, but kin, forever woven into the song of Manaki.

So let us feast! Let us dance! Let the flames rise and the laughter echo across the land, as we remember the day our two peoples became one, bound by shared hearth and story.

As the elderly woman finishes her tale she reaches down to the ground and from below great stone tables rise all across the open square, ready to host all the bounties of the earth and sea.
Gather close, my friends, for now we speak not of joy, but of sorrow and redemption. Today, I tell you of the great betrayal that poisoned our land, and the courage that rose to cleanse it. This is the tale of Skati Fylkir, the dark king who sought to make the Isles his own - and the spirit of Kadaur who struck him down.

When the Ikolf first came to our shores, they were welcomed as kin, but among them walked a serpent disguised as king. Skati Fylkir, the ruler of the Ikolf, had once been a man of great promise - a leader, wise and strong. But his heart had been twisted by his thirst for power. In his pride, he sought not only to rule his people, but to conquer the very forces of life and death.

In secret, Skati delved into forbidden rituals, seeking eternal life. He turned his back on the teachings of his ancestors, choosing instead to defile the sacred land of Manaki with magic of blood and deceit. He drew strength not from the love of his people or the bounty of the land, but from the very life force of the Isles themselves. With every sacrifice, with every drop of blood spilled in his name, Skati grew in power and spirit.
 
The Manaki, wise and close to the spirits of the Isles, saw through his lies. They knew the land was sickening under his rule, the spirits whispering of his treachery. But the Ikolf settlers, blinded by his silver tongue, could not see the truth. They followed him into darkness, believing his false promises of paradise.

But not all hope was lost. Kadaur, the spirit of this very land - the mountains, the rivers, the earth beneath our feet - watched in silence, waiting with the patience of stone. Until the day of his awakening.

It was on a day much like this, with the sun just breaking over the horizon, that Skati made his final mistake. He declared war upon the Manaki, seeking to bend them to his will and use their strength to fuel his twisted rituals. But in that moment, the Ikolf settlers saw the truth. They saw the cruelty that had poisoned their king�s heart, and they turned on him.

And then, Kadaur rose.

From the heart of the mountain, the great spirit manifested a champion - our great hero Kada, bearing the legendary spear Marrow. With the Manaki and Ikolf united at his side, Kada led the charge against Skati. They stormed his temple of sacrifice, the place where so many lives had been unjustly taken. His dark power rivaling all of his kin combined.

But even Skati�s sorcery was no match for the spirit of the Isles. Kada thrust his spear through Skati�s blackened heart, pinning him to the altar of his own making. The earth trembled, and Skati�s scream echoed across the Isles, but it was too late for him. His tyranny ending with his final breath.
 
To this day, Skati�s cursed body remains imprisoned in that temple, bound by the warding stones placed by both Manaki and Ikolf. The land healed, the people were freed, and once more, the Isles breathed in peace.

So let us remember this tale, not just of a king�s fall, but of the unity that saved us. The spirits of Manaki, the courage of its people, and the strength of Kadaur all rose to defend this land, and they stand with us still.

As the elder finishes her story, she lifts her hand to her heart, and gentle winds sweep across the crowd, warm silence falls upon the village and a feeling of peace and unity falls upon the people.

The smell of iron hangs in the air as you draw nearer the fa- bled temple. Moving closer, you hear the patter of rainfall just ahead, but as you emerge from the living jungle�s edge, you find a horrific sight. Red clouds loom over dead, blood-soaked flora as the source of the noise is revealed to be a constant rain of blood falling from the sky.
The temple stands before you, resting near a high cliff over- hanging the ocean. Its features are mostly unobscured by the thick presence of blood in the area, with a clear cobblestone path emerging from the dead ferns beneath your feet. The silhouette of a figurehead looms at the top of the temple, but as you draw closer, you realize the figurehead is in fact Skomm Fylkir himself pinned to the tower by a spear

This is what Kada was saying mostly:
Kada gathers the villagers and warns them that the eruption implies a great magical force is about to change the Isles. The heroic spirit says that in its weakened state, it can�t defend the Isles by itself. Kada calls upon the strongest-willed people in the village, requesting that they head quickly to Fylkir�s Fall and ensure that Skomm Fylkir hasn�t returned.

*After the second throw something small starts to speedily move towards them, and the people can catch a glimpse of a small baby hog running in between the two, just before both of them jump back barely avoiding the mamahog who follows and just charges through the clearing after her baby, luckily disregarding the duo.*

We might start the campaign either way, cuz I really don't want everyone to wait so long (and I'm also in the mood to finally DM again).
You could join later if things become a bit more stable or play a guest character maybe. We'd need to hammer out the details on this.

That steampunk adventure
The other 45 homebrew ideas of yours
Witchlight isn't even my idea xD
Now it is
And Tbor would cost a whole lot of dough that's why it's not happening. 45k huf is not an amount I would want to pay for an adventure.
Tbor?
Wtf?
Wait not tbor
Burning sky
E
It's a 12 arc adventure and every arc is 10usd
Cuz the 5e one didn't get a full book. They only sell it in party cuz the converion was outsourced and the other party is getting more money this way
Lame
Xd
Idk
I'd love chains tho
I'd love to run anything xD
I just miss being behind the screen
I still think chiains would be the logical thing to start. We have multiple characters ready and its the most recent adventure we got hyped on
But I also pushed chains back last time cuz someone asked me to. I don't want to play favourites.
true
then do ody

*Papa enyh�n r�ncolja a homlok�t �s n�mi hitetlenked�s figyelhet� meg meginog� mosoly�n ahogy az �jabban eldobott kavics ir�ny�ba n�z.* -�rtem. *Nem igaz�n tudv�n hogyan reag�ljon innent� kezdve csak int �s elbotork�l.*
(This guy cant be real(
(Im just saying, like....)
(XDDDD)
(I love it xD throws another stone like nothing just happened xD)
(I love how Papa is just there like... "this guy is insane" xD)
*Kuwe'i int egyet a t�voz� Pap�nak, majd folytatja az aranyf�ny� kavicsok dob�l�s�t.*
*Papa m�g utolj�ra vissza pillant �s odasz�l a fi�nak.* -Biztos j� �tlet ez?
� Most m�r csak nincsenek t�bben!
*Vonja meg a v�ll�t Kuwe'i a vaddiszn�-fam�li�ra utalva.*
� De �tm�szhatok ink�bb a tengerhez kavicskacs�zni, ha att�l nyugodtabban hajtot a fejed nyugov�ra.
(XDDDD)
(Nagyon �lem eddig ezt a convo-t xD)
-Nem csak a te �rdekedben k�rdezem. *V�laszol egy enyhe mosollyal.* -Azok a kavicsok hamar vissza rep�lhetnek fel�d.
*Megr�ntja a szem�ld�k�t fitoktat� m�don �s sz�lesebbre h�zza sz�j�t.*
( dice god stfu)

� Na, ha a kavicsok t�nyleg magukt�l rep�lni kezdenek, akkor fogok felmondani.
*M�g egy utols� k�vet elhaj�t, felkap egy �jat, majd egy, csapatt�l t�volabbi ponttal a tenger partj�n kezd szemezni, testtart�sa azt sugalja, hogy arrafel� indulna tov�bb.*
� Er�sen k�tlem hogy b�rmi baj lehetne, de ott legal�bb nem fogok m�st "bajba keverni".
*Unottan Pap�ra pillant, mint aki szentig meg van gy�z�dve arr�l, hogy az aggodalom teljesen felesleges, de minden esetre hallgat arra, hogy (itt) ne folytassa tov�bb.*
� Majd sik�tok ha kim�szik a korall, rendben?
I cant with this dude
Im so done already
*Papa egyet�rt�en b�lint �s b�lcsen megindul.* -Rendben. Legal�bb tudni fogjuk merre ne menj�nk. *Ezzel visszas�t�l a t�bort�zh�z.*
(Doesnt he like...suppose to know how things work here? XDDD)
(Oh, he does xDDDDD)
(Ah. Just god complex, i see)
(Kinda xDDDD)
(Im so close to smack him with the cane)
(You can absolutely go for it xD i'd love to see that xDDDD)
(Nah. Not yet. M�g k�v�ncsi vagyok meddig fog elmenni ezzel a hozz��ll�ssal)
(I got an idea, you up for more rp a few hours after this one?)
-Mert nem vagyok falusi. *Jelenti ki egyszer�en.*
(After Kuwe'i returns from the seashore? XD)
(Papa confirmed not being a minecraft villager)
(Would Papa be sleeping by then?)
(Idk. Sure?)
(I mean we can rp)
(De m�r most szeretn�d, hogy meglegyen rendezve? XD)
(*assuming he survives)
(Csak kiv�ncsi vagyok meddig tudja Kuwe'i h�zni az idegelet xD)
(OYAH)
(WHAT XD)
(H�t �n is.)
with Kuwe'i? XDD
Yes
Eml�kszem mikor �n csin�ltam ezt
*Egy-k�t �r�val k�s�bb, Kuwe'i lassan �s csendesen t�r vissza, egy vastagabb bottal piszk�lva Pap�t am�g fel nem kel.*
� Pops! �bren?
*A bot t�k�letesen tudna szolg�lni ak�r s�tap�lcak�nt is m�snak.*
I mean I'm having fun reading it :D
*Papa egy k�v�n �l nem messze a t�bbiekt�l.*
-Hm? *Fordul meg meglepetten, de az hamar �tfordul egy f�radt mosolly� a manaki fel�.* -Ah, Kuwei, l�tom nem ettek meg a korallok.
� Heh, szerencs�re nem.
*A sr�c combt�l lefel� csurom v�z, a boton amit az el�bb piszk�l�d�sra haszn�lt, most egy kez�vel azt t�masznak haszn�lja, vigyora az arc�n enyhe f�jdalommal teli.*
� Eml�kszel mit aj�nlottam kor�bban?
*Le�l a f�ldre, bal talp�t az �l�be emelve, amib�l apr�, fekete t�sk�k �llnak ki. Ujjaival odany�l az els�h�z, ami egy apr� szisszen�st k�nyszer�t ki a sr�cb�l.*
� J�ttem hisztizni.
(XD)
(XDDDD)
(tegnap voltam akv�riumban, azok a t�sk�k NEM APR�K XD)
(t�bb fajta tengeri s�n l�tezik)
look at the size of those shits
(Jav�tva xD)
(ja? enn�l van nagyobb ia)
(Hm?)
(yea ezt csak tal�ltam random a neten most,it already proved the point so I stopped looking xddd)
(yeah but like...there is worse xddd)
*Honyorogva r�pillat Kuweire, a mosoly minduntalan �l az arc�n �s csak b�lint egyet.* -Meg t�rt�nt aminek meg kellett. *Feleli halk t�nusban.* -Rendben, megtenn�l nekem valamit?
(Kuwe'i titokban bele van z�gva pap�ba �s csak az�rt tette ezt direkt mag�val hogy j�hessen t�bbet besz�lgetni vele XDD)
(neki kamalani tetszik, sorry)
(Im�dom hogy eld�nt�tt�tek ki a crush-a Kuwe'inek xD)
(tudjuk, hogy samantha)
(XD noooooo)
*Kuwe'i megfogja az egyik t�sk�t, �s egy gyors r�nt�ssal kih�zza, amire egy halk morg�s t�r fel a tork�ban.*
� Nem ez az els� alkalom hogy belel�pek egybe. De minden alkalommal ugyan�gy f�j.
*F�jdalmas vigyorra h�zza a sz�j�t, majd Pap�ra n�z ahogy a k�vetkez� t�sk�nek is neki esik.*
� Menjek arr�bb? Azt hittem szeretted volna ha hisztizek neked.
*Papa csak sz� n�lk�l r�csap Kuwei kez�re a botj�val.*
*Nem t�l er�sen, de �pp annyira, hogy meg�rezze �s elkapja onnan a kez�t.*
(veri a gyereket!)
(a 25 �ves gyereket)
� H�! �u! Csin�ltam m�r ilyet! Ki kell h�znom miel�tt begy�gy�thatn�m.
*Megr�zza k�zfej�t, �s m�r ny�lna is vissza a t�sk�khez.*
*Ism�t csak r�csap. Papa arca rezzen�stelen �s csak t�relmesen �l tov�bb mozdulatmentesen.* -Hozz vizet. *Jelenti ki finom hangon �s v�rja, hogy Kuwei reag�ljon.*
(szeg�ny most s�ntik�lhat el v�z�rt xd)
(�gy j�rt)
(vagyis pont hogy nem, mert eddig k�t l�bon)
*A manaki lefagyva, kerek szemekkel, hitetlenkedve n�z Pap�ra.*
� Vizet? �gy? Minek a v�z?
*Egy visszafolytott s�hajjal n�zi Kuweit �s meg�t�geti a f�ldet maga el�tt.* -Haria mai. (Hozzd ide) *Adja ki a parancsot m�g egyszer.*
-Turituri kia tere.
*S�hajtva a sr�c ism�t a botra t�maszkodik, elbotork�l a vizes kulacs��rt, majdnem felborulva egy kisebb szikl�ban. Percek ut�n sikeresen visszabotork�l a Pap�hoz, lehuppan a f�ldre, majd ism�t �l�be veszi a l�b�t.*
� Itt van. Most m�r folytathatom? El�gg� f�j �m.
*�s ism�t ny�lna hogy kih�zza a k�vetkez� t�sk�t.*
*Papa most csak sim�n eltolja a kez�t a bottal. Am�g Kuwei el volt, � el� keresett egy t�lat, vagy valamit, amibe bele �ntheti a vizet �s a f�rfi l�ba is bele f�r. Elveszi a vizet �s a kont�nerbe �nti.* -Ka pai. K�sz�n�m. *Let�masztja a botot maga mell� �s k�t kez�be veszi a vizest�lk�t.*
*Megel�gelve hogy Papa nem engedi kih�zni a t�sk�ket, kezeit a cs�p�j�re teszi �s morcosan fintorra h�zi a sz�j�t.*
� El�ruln�d mi�rt nem engeded hogy megcsin�ljam? Nem ez az els� alkalom hogy s�nbe l�ptem, gyakran havonta el�fordul. El�g gyakorlott vagyok a t�sk�k kiszed�s�ben.
*Egy kicsit k�zelebb csusszan a sr�c, szem�ld�k�t felvonva.*
� El�g vizes m�r �gy is a talpam...
*K�zben ujj�val beleny�l a t�l meleg v�zbe.*
� Ez t�l meleg.
*Felvont szem�ld�kkel felpillant Kuweire, hogy most t�nyleg ezt akarja e.*
*Az eddig sikeresen elfojtott, pimasz vigyora most v�gre el�re t�r az arc�n.*
� Lazulj m�r el, csak sz�rakozok!
*A t�lra tekint, majd a l�b�ra, majd ism�t a t�lra.*
� Most komolyan dugjam bele a l�bam? M�r r�g v�gezhettem volna a t�skeszed�ssel.
*Csak er�sen bele nyomja a l�b�t a v�zbe, vigy�zva, hogy a t�sk�k nehogy jobban belemenjenek a talp�ba.*
*A v�z kellemes �s hamar ellaz�tja Kuwei l�b�t, enyh�tve a cs�p�st �s az �get� �rz�st.*
� J�, ok�, �gy nem f�j annyira, de m�g mindig benne vannak a t�sk�k.
*Karj�t m�sik l�ba t�rd�re pihenteti, majd el�r�bb d�l hogy jobban meg tudja n�zni a v�zben �z� talp�t.*
� Lehet hogy kellemes a v�z, de m�r t�nyleg r�g t�l lehetn�k ezen...
*Papa sz� n�lk�l v�r m�g egy j� 5 percet, ami tal�n Kuweinek �r�kk�val�s�gig tarthat.*

i cant believe im still this calm about it xddd
� De most komolyan, meddig akarjuk m�g h�zni?
*Vinnyog az els� perc ut�n.*
� Tudom m�r. �lvezed hogy n�zheted ahogy szenvedek. "Mert �n megmondtam, nemde?" "Megt�rt�nt aminek meg kellett t�rt�nnie" "Na majd tanulsz ebb�l"
*Papa hangj�t ut�nozva g�nyol�dik a m�sodik �s harmadik percben.*
� Na �s ha tiszt�ban vagyok mindezzel? Mi van �lvezem a vesz�lyt? Felp�rget. �rzem hogy �l k�r�l�ttem a vil�g, �rzem hogy �lek ebben a vil�gban.
*Motyogja a negyedik percben, az �t�dikben meg csak n�m�n a csillagokat kezdi b�mulni.*
*Papa nem sz�l semmit csak egyre f�radtabbnak t�nik. Miut�n letelt az a kis id�, kiveszi Kuwei l�b�t a v�zb�l �s a t�lat arr�bb tolja.* -E noho. Oda. *Mutat a pontra, ahol ez el�bb �lt a manaki.*
*M�g mindig Kuwei l�b�t fogja.*
*Egy pillanatnyi szuger�l�s ut�n Kuwe'i gondolkod�s n�lk�l sz�ra nyitja a sz�j�t, miel�tt m�g �tgondolhatn�, mit mond.*
� Olyan mintha nem lenne unok�d �s most helyette rajtam �led ki milyen lenne egy ut�n gondoskodni... t�nyleg meg tudom csin�lni, csak hisztizni akartam.
*Egy pillanatig le sem esik neki hogy amit mondott, az el�g rosszindulat� is lehet, de h�t amit kimondott, azt m�r nem lehet visszavonni. Mikor erre r�j�n, megk�sz�r�li a tork�t, �s gyorsan t�m�t v�lt.*
� Csak nem tetszik neked a l�bam? Az�rt fogdosod m�g mindig? Biztos �lvezed azt a massz�zst, ahol a h�tunkon taposnak a massz�r l�nyok.

hey hey hey!
Why is it in the archives? XF
Lol. I'mma move it. Gimme 5 minutes
24-es D&D lesz?
yes yes
dnd 5.5
with the new monsters >:)
I'd like to try rogue or monk probably
Oh yeah both are really fun now.
Rogues get special moves, but they have to sacrifice a bit of damage for them with cunning strike
they basically spend their sneak attack dice to like
do poison shots
TRICK SHOTS
Or knock you prone and similar
At high levels they can knock enemies out by basically throwing away all damage they would do
ye
they are like WoW rogues now xd
they can do a kidney shot
Your ideas Reg�?
uuuhm
heist
hmmm
we are like
is it kinda like alken?
we form a team and we go and rob banks?
Kinda. Gm b�csi some player context
pingeld meg mert nem fog v�laszolni
<@377469395007438849>
Coonerman
only player context is for some reason you came to waterdeep
and find a reason why you need 5 mil gold

Kinda ezek szerint
Can it be for the thrill of the heist?
sure
Erin?
oh my
Erin time?
oh my
Hmmmmmm
Nah. Erin is a mid level character not a lvl1
She's lvl 12-14 remember?
Probably just 12
and remember
its just a 1-5
(until we go down the lift in the yawning tavern)
thats a 5-20
IF
you want to we could do it after
But lets not gat ahead of our se�fs
Did you ask Nika if she wants to play here?
its mostly for those who are close to you
and also are willing to take the time and effort to travel to you xd
not yet
M�rk would kocsika from Zirc to here. She'd have a ride here and back as well.
sould i
?
Sure. Irl games and filler style campaign. She might be interested

I need to buy 2 chairs before the game starts tho xD
Fuuuuuck
no need
we just need a playmat
that deast aint big ennoug for shite
are we using your new DM screen? :33
Not everyone is cozy with the idea of sitting on the ground for 3-4 hours. We just need to stop putting montains of snacks on the table and it will be fine
So we will have at least 1 bitchboi on the team. Does that change anyone's character ideas? XD
no
https://youtu.be/BLcM3fq6Quk?si=DVTA5HT5pGOI1QLY
im probably playing a cleric again
or a lock
-# (I would advise against cuz you might get bored playing the same class in two campaigns at the same time.)
Hey
What makes you think i'll bring a bitchboi?
Ya know i could play a woman too? Maybe something more animalistic?
It's not always i choose the bitchbois
So anyway
I got this new bitchboi idea
ooh?
tell me
https://tenor.com/view/exactly-meme-gif-339571032222189743
Too bad he's not a lvl 1 character :(
But also
I got this other bitchboi idea
And another
And i also got a scorpio-offspring to play
One day
Maybe

Legal�bbis az id�pontot

nem lesznek ide j�l
*l
*k
Mert el�z� kiad�shoz van. But we can move things around + we have a guide on how to make custom backgrounds
J�v� h�ten egy session zero?
Ha alken elmarad akkor ak�r holnap is megtarthatjuk
Will we have downtime occasionally?
Ha irl akkor a h�tk�znapok neccesek, sosem tudom meddig kell bent maradnom, b�r usually 2 ut�n m�r szabad vagyok
A h�tv�ge meg k�rd�ses, vas�rnap van anyu sz�linapja
Szombat should be free
Nekem is csak 2 ut�n valamikor j�
Legkor�bban 4kor tudom fogadni a gang-et
So that is fine
H�nyan lenn�nk btw?
Probably the main group here. Endre v�g�l nem ny�ron j�n sajnos.
Aww
Ja de akkor az 7et jelent
Damn xd
Tal�ltam egy aranyosat de az csak 6os xd
B�r van Balatonlell�n egy aranyos m�g amiben asszem elf�rn�nk
Csak el�g �rdekesen lett kiirva a f�r�helyek r�sz xD
<@875753704685436938> Rock Burger?
What that?
Nika kedvenc k�zm�ves hamburgerez�je.
Aah
Pesten vagy, vagy mizu? xD
Nope, Balatonlell�n
Wait nooooo
Nikaaaaaa
Bez�rt a Rock Burger

Indeed
NEMMONDOD
PET�CI�
PET�CI�T MOST
A facebook oldalukon is ott van sajnos
NE M�R
MI��RTTT
Az a m�sik hamburgeres ami ott volt nem messze valszeg kitolta �ket a piacr�l.
You know the one where I got served raw chicken
M�g csak nem is volt olyan finom az a m�sik... >:(
L�f@szt a segg�kbe
ROCK BURGEEERR
T~T
But it was pretty and in the town center. Easily accessible from Lidl and Aldi
I would have liked to eat rock burger at least once more T-T
I'm literally on the verge of tears
Like why
WHYY
Fuck thiiisss....
Bud�n m�g van xD
We could go there next time
*With da gang*
Oh wait yeah fuck
That is the same rock burger
Wat
Same logo and menu
It's them
In Buda
Did they move?
I have no clue but it's them
u will
ha holnap mindenkinek ok akkor fel�lem megtarthatjuk
M�g nem tudni, hogy elmarad-e Alken. Endre m�g nem �rt vissza, de ha �r majd sz�lok
�n kitakar�tok �s �gy k�sz�l�k, hogy j�tt�k a biztons�g kedv��rt
I wanna play something with heavy armor and a pauldron
I mean any character can have a pauldron. It's an accessory
But hmmmm
Fighter, cleric, paladin? Maybe barb but that isn't heavy armor.
God I just realised how few classes use heavy armor
Yeah
Nekem nem j�
Holnap m�r van d�lut�n programom kb. 6-ig
Lehet elny�lik
Anna megy a saj�t heistj�ra
D&D, where having a pauldron is an accessory
But it always was in fantasy xD
Rogues had it everywhere, barbarians, sometimes even mages
D&D armor is a joke, yeah
No? It's a game with limitations
And accessories were always part of fantasy.
No, I mean you can add any number of armor to your body, you can be decked out and you'd still have less armor than someone with high dex and like a studded leather
So relative to each other they are wonky
That's also wrong. Heavy armor will always be at least 1 AC ahead if  the DM isn't an ass about giving the players appropriate kit
Usually more like 3 or 4 ahead. (With adding shield and defense fighting style)
Dodging fireballs
Shield master
The best armor is just being good at dex
and being a rogue
I don't argue with Dex being way too overused in the system
Rogues are fine tho. They hit like wet noodles after 5th level and if you hit them more than once per turn they go down really fast.
They are hard to kill in single monster fights tho
Insane mobility and constant invis
<:suneannoyed:1240006684504752199>
No... You are not wrong its very good, but if something manages to connect. God help the pure soul
\- The dragon will use it's breath attack
\- No problem I have evasion
\- Roll me a Consave.
<:oricry:1266108627366711368>
Well yeah, they are still paper underneath the sick moves
(Also Grei was insanely overbuffed. Like my god that is just dumb levels of overbuffed xD)
But when you can sidestep a bomb, that is needed I guess
I wasn't even thinking about Grei
He was also a barb
Resistance and buffed cunning defense. Grei just said no to being hit.
He didn't halve the damage
He said no.
If you managed to crit him he downgraded your attack to a regular hit and he still had resistance against it
yeah
no
I have nightmares from the PoB team sometimes
did i meantion you aint gonna be a demigod?
and please
get some potions
they are good now
Meanwhile Reg�'s character:
https://tenor.com/view/hercules-gif-27150515
?? No?
Basic fighter
Champion
Akkor kital�lok valami m�st <a:dracthyr_cry_animated:1004776113760911401>
XDD
No need
You can go bm
No. Fu
Ill be a cleric
Dear <@618475228695232532>, You've reached level 62!
�n akkor rug� leszek ha m�s nem tart r� ig�nyt
No, go ahead. Should be really fun in a campaign like this
So a BM fighter, a cleric, and a rogue so far
I have a lot of ideas so the BM is not 100% yet
Yeah, subclass-b�l val�sz�n�leg ilyen thief/mastermind/inquisitive lenne
Reg� can grab if he wants. My other idea would have been a cleric probably xd
A thief-t tuti �tvitt�kHl
Nincs inquidsitive
But i dont wanna play a fighted. Ill be a cleric
(24 has Thief, Assassin, AT and Soul Knife)
*arcane trickster
Akkor thief lesz
Are you sure? Playing the same class in 2 games side by side?
DiceGod always found the bottom of the tables by "right before the archived table"
And I forgot to change it
It is literally what I coded for you
Yeah
Cleric is really versitle
I know, but that is still a chance to burn out. But if you can manage, you do you.
No respect
Dicegod el lesz n�sp�ngolva
Your idea?
*God daaaaamn fjords are gorgeous*
Will send pics after the vacation
No idea
Nah, no idea xD
We have skirmisher and skill monkey, melee dps and tank, support and tank so far.
No true caster so far.
Imagine a wizard
The real DnD party?
Cleric, Fighter, Rogue and Wizard?
Really would've loved a dudu but it's outta question again xD
Nop, not from lvl 1
You can always talk with Reg�
Nah, dudu is not a heist class imo
Kara-Tur is the asian place, right?
I could play a K-pop dancer bard wtf xD
And it'd still be k-pop
Cuz kara tur
XD
Nahh
If a stealthy rat and pass without trace are not heist things I don't know what would be.
I'd be a joke
Fair
But still
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
Doesn't fit into my fantasies, dudu as a heist class
https://tenor.com/view/junhui-jun-seventeen-kpop-svt-gif-15496968171639268967

Btw it is raining since we got here, so we might actually be in London
Buffed sorc is also there. You almost came when I listed off the improvements last time xD
I had so many sorcies alreadyyy T-T
That's also true. Addiction is hell of a drug
do a melee
a gauca melee
No
Fu

https://tenor.com/view/guacamelee-juan-aguacate-drink-box-studios-lucha-libre-lucha-gif-21548073
Man i love a bitchboi with nice rizz and moves
Might gonna go with bard
But idk
We have a skillmonkey already
Bards can be more tho. Especially if you guys coordinate your skills
Hmm
Might
Might actually, then
We'll see
dudu is better for heist then a bard imo
or a cleric
But stacking wis based casters.
She wanted to dudu in Sunken as well
Until you chose cleric there as well xD
but like...we can choose entirely different skills
This will become a tradition
and spells
It's about the dudu fantasy i have in my head, and in my head a dudu doesn't need 5million gold they'd need to do a heist for xD
they might
But in my head, they just simply don't
imagine, an enclave member might need that kind of money to pay off a noble fucker not to settle his new industry in the druids forestr
or something like that
To buy the whole freaking forest and make sure it's super chill
sure
a personal reservation
If no inspectors come cuz it's a private property you can grow as much duduweed as you want.
24/7 high for this hippie
or
like
druids can be really fucking disruptive
cuz fuck civilization
so id sooner see a druid bandit then a cleric
or a paladin
But I also get it cuz this is an urban campaign
fair i guess
(So about evil gods)
I'll stay with something else i think
sure
just our ideas
Yes
de nem kell m�g egyszer ugyan azt elj�tszanunk xd
sz�val mondd mit j�tszan�l
�s akkor �n nem azt fogom hozni xd
<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378> <:VeryHmm:963844125155811378> <:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
You can bring your cleric, i'm not gonna/don't wanna play dudu here
I'll focus on something else
Bard sounds fun
But idk yet
Can i play a netrunner? :'D
Wrong setting dude
Ahh fuck
And netrunners are wizards so that's a double nope xD
Yeah but netrunners are cool. Wizards are nerdy fuckers xD
jk
no
:(
if you cant choose
i wil >:)
Nop
Then i'm out xD
...
Sorry i'm unable to play something others tell me what to play
I already have a hard time connecting with my characters, the characters i create into what i want them to be
But also, it was a joke from both sides
I think it's pretty obvious
Lehet ez nehezebb lesz mint gondoltuk xd
Minden geci dr�ga xD
yes
*m�r most*
�s minden vagy 6 vagy 10 f�s
No inbetween
I mean
Nem kell kit�lteni
Csak legyen el�g hely xD
i mean we still can go to szentisp�n no?
Sure
�n nem mondtam hogy ne xD
Csak j� lenne valami m�s is t�nyleg
De ja dr�ga
yeah but money
Elosztva nem lenne �m durva
Csak van aki nem tud annyit beleadni, �gy meg m�r picit bajos
csak �gy hogy most minuszba vagyok nem biztos hogy bev�laln�m
H�t nem is most lesz m�g ugye
yeah but still
Csak id�pont miatt k�ne el�re tervezni xd
aug probs
Aug nekem nem biztos, hogy j� lesz
nekem jun/jul kb ki van l�ve
aug vagy sep
Sep az egyetem
So no
Aug vagy j�li
K�ne egy megosztott napt�r ahol mindenki beirja hogy mi j� �s kiv�lasztjuk a legt�bbeknek j� id�pontot xd
Az eg�sz Aug?
Probably csak a v�ge de m�g nem tudni pontosan
Hmm
M�sik nyaral�s?
Maybe. Csal�d is agyal rajta, hogy nem lenne rossz m�r valamit kital�lni k�z�sen
Plusz lehet megyek a t�borba ami szint�n aug
Well damn
<@&1209957580164702270> 
it seems like we are skipping sess then with the two ppl down
<:oricry:1266108627366711368>
Okay I'm done with character creation and backstory
I could be there from around 20:30 if that's anything xd
*just a lil hour and a half late* xD
If we start session at that time I would perish on tuesday xD
You guys are slow
Short session xD
Nah it's fine tho
Next week then I guess
Hopefully I can attend xd
But
I won't promise
But I *can* always make it around 20:30
So I hop in halfway xD
I might still join as Guns and Gears remaster came out
Eyo?
Remaster talks?
And Bran's 5th rebuild
XDD
xD
Ja, bocs, �n csak a v�rban voltam v�gighallgatni a harangokr�l sz�l� prezit, meg megn�zegett�k �ket m�g miel�tt visszarakj�k �ket a k�vi ki tudja h�ny �vtizedre xd
*I couldn't split my mind. I'm weak for that, I know*
im dicklestik
its not 5 mil gold but 500k
but still its a good sum of money :D
.
Ah okay
I misread
More than anyone would ever need
https://youtube.com/shorts/v_uQR94nnro?si=PmKxSz72ZhwbZD6P
this IS in the actual game
xD
https://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/1j1kn1q/when_youre_the_first_daughter_you_handle_things
so
yeah we need only your characters now
Milyen race-ek vannak 24-ben?
Vannak �jak amik eddig nem voltak?
Aasimar 
Dragonborn 
Dwarf 
Elf 
Gnome 
Goliath 
Halfling 
Human 
Orc
Tiefling
Ezek a mostaniak
Hm
Rogue goliath
or a dragonborn maybe
Those are the ones I haven't played and I'm actually interested in
also orc
But probably not for this
why not?
orc rogue can go hard
dragonborns now get limited flight
Because I already played half orc and that's close enough, and I haven't at all played goliath or db
*Praktiker fit check*
My shirt is too long xD
I mean
*it fits*
xDDDD
*ofc to work I'll be wearing pants*
*unfortunately*
XDD
Can't rock my shirt as a mini dress
Tragic
Maybe with leggings
I mean these are tights that are thicker than leggings
But I don't think they'd appreciate the fashion forwardness of it all xD
*they simply wouldn't understand*
Trying is always an option
*Don't let society bring you down* XD
*She had a sense for fashion, but they rejected her for it. Forced to live like the masses, she suffered every day for their and her own lack of style.*
Oh also pistols and Muskets are now baseline weapons peeps
But they are picy
oh my
well m�g j�, hogy heistolni megy�nk
https://tenor.com/view/cat-crying-cat-cat-meme-cat-crying-meme-crying-cat-meme-gif-1182720488497099882
*Go and assert dominance in the workplace with this fit. You can get this look for 3.99$ in your local Praktiker*
Na de naah megleszek gaty�ban xD
Pistols are 250gp for 1 handed 1d10 ranged and Muskets are 500gp for 1d12 2 handed ranged

like those pirate pistols?
And they cost 3 silver per shot xD
Yes
3gp egy 10es ammunition pack hozz�juk. Expensive
jeez
You're gonna leave the belt and the energy drink shoes on tho, right?
XDD
Aristocratic ranged combat.
*Fast on her feet and armed with the discipliner9000*
*Pulls the trigger*
\- Look squire! This was your daily wage.
Hm, I'd try
Brother, we'll be thieves. They cost as much as 0 + our skills
We're not thieves
Yet
Oh wait
Okay, by definition, true. Only on lvl 3
XD
But we are going to rob a place, or rob from a place
Stealing our setup might as well be the warm-up
The energy drink shoes for suer stay on
They are the work shoes I was given xD
J� kis ac�lbet�tes
Well, I would've liked a revolvo, not a flintlock or other one shot pistols but oh well
The belt unfortunately has to go probs
Revolvo would be way too advanced for the sword coast sadly
kickin' shoes
*Sad, revolvoless heisting*
I have to solve it the good old fashioned way
Also since Mark told us to remember potions: 
# Simple potions of healing now cost 50gp and can be bought without restrictions as they became adventuring gear
Steal
This reminded me that I need to get new working shoes are mine are falling apart again
I mean come on, if we can't steal some potions and some equipment we should reconsider going heisting at all
||Am i the only one for who firearms ruin the high/epic fantasy (setting) entirely?||
We won't steal everything tho. We will probably have a single target to steal during the module. (And you don't want to anger the guy who provides our equipment)
||I think so, yeah. Waterdeep isn't high fantasy. It's medieval urban fantasy. Some drow already have guns in other waterdeep modules, I expect them to have it here as well.||
Lame
https://tenor.com/view/yas-queen-yasss-girl-sassy-gif-24235716
You might not
I on the other hand *might just* help myself to some extra stuff
vaterdeep is more victorian
then medieval
Also if the game has rapiers, guns should fit as well. Rapiers were made long after guns first saw use in medieval times. \:D
If I get the chance
Somewhere between the two would be perfect I think
Space jammers are what exactly?
Ships that go to space and travel through dimensions or something like that? I can't remember
||But like... history don't make sense in fantasy? Like... i wanna see swords of any kind in fantasy, if i wanna see firearms, i'll choose literally anything else than fantasy xd||
You don't need to spoiler it
Yes. Luckily the sword coast isn't heavily in the spacejammer things.
I wanna cuz it might ruin the mood for others
You won't
There are plenty of things that break the high/epic fantasy vibe in D&D
I see your point, but Sword coast always had black powder guns. Or like... Smokepowder guns cuz Black powder can't explode here.
�s mi se j�tszuk annyira fantasy-san, legal�bbis nekem sosem �rz�d�tt annyira annak
Sword coast and faerun are a kitchen sink setting. It has everything for the sake of having everything
Idk i tolerate a lot of things in fantasy, but not firearms :/
Riiight the gunk left in the drainer xd
*sad artificer noises*
We usually bring characters with more modern sensibilities anyway, and we mix and match stuff all the time
I can't feel the whimsy that usually comes with HF
Exactly. Pirates on water, pirates in the air, dragon riders, griff riders, robot griff riders, giant mechs, warhammer super suits, smokepowder guns, plasmaguns, antimater guns, spaceships, sword and multiple civilasations designer around someones personal kinks
true tho i wouldnt mind something with that kind of tone
like
Am�gy meg nem val�sz�n�, hogy actually szerzek pisztolyt, mert hangos
�s mert k�r�lm�nyes
dying of the flue and leeches on skin kinda stuff
just get a silence scroll
�s mert val�sz�n�leg megoldom ugyanazt a sebz�sz m�s, halkabb eszk�z�kkel, amiket nem kell minden egyes l�v�s ut�n �jrat�lteni �s nem akadnak be
I think that would go into low fantasy territory.
Enn�l m�g az �n future-rachea �tletem is konzisztensebb a clockwork-cyber-magic-dragon-punk mindens�g�vel
https://youtu.be/qXrn4MqY1Wo?feature=shared
damn
Cuz you're overseeing everything you're writing
You're a single writer while SC had around 50 novelists work on it
All adding in their own parts, ideas and lore, even if they clashed
>:(
For 50 years now may I add
and its like what...50+ years of lore?
oh ye i just noticed xd
Yes you're exactly right
�ltal�ban sokkal science/rules/rationale based-ek vagyunk
That's why Ed Greenwood's Sword coast seems like a mess compared to Tolkien's Middle Earth.
?
Tolkien had complete rule over his setting. Ed had control until someone's idea brought more money
A D&D minden akar lenni, ez�rt semmi se igaz�n
Just angy over how mishmash the setting is
Because our games in my head are usually closer to a tolkien adventure than... something else
And how the firearm ruins it for me? Imagine gandalf the gray whipping out a gun and marching into battle with that
Like... it's so fucking out of place xd
I would laugh so hard
But D&D was never LotR
It wasn't even close
BUT i could see Gimli pulling a single shot pistol out
I agree, that would be jarring
No, i wouldn't, because it was not advertised as a joke parody
K�rd meg Bandit, hogy amikor majd futtat LotR-t, besz�llhass
I never said it is. I said it was closer to that
Nekem mindig Wow fantasy volt a dnd a fejemben.
Too many games already
I treat it as a finicky tedious lil' shit that only lets me do about a third of the stuff I actually want
<@618475228695232532> could comment on this
If we look at the official content, no homebrew
Give the next pf adventure a chance. After Alken perhaps. I think you'd enjoy it.
Azt akarom
Azt mondtam M�rknak is
Player positions will open up for sure. I have too much on my plate to join the next one
I was asked if I wanted to play
and I said yes
In the season if ghosts yes
Csak m�g meg kell szavazni, hogy Cthulhu, vagy PF legyen
Mit akarnak jobban az emberek
naaah
wow is too childish
and unserious
and
generic
Nowadays for sure
I was thinking about oldschool wow
R�gen egyszer� volt, de legal�bb voltak benne oomph-ok
Lich king era wow
ah yes
nekem is pont az jutott eszembe
that was epic
Meg am�gy nekem a D&D az mindig olyan volt, hogy m�g az epic fantasy-nak is nagyon olyan lagymatag
(I'm sorry Nika)
Nekem mindig az van meg, hogy az epic fantasy akkor epic fantasy ha egy soha meg nem t�rt�nt hatalmas epic plotot visznek v�ghez a h�s�k. Pl Ody, Raiders, Lotr and similar. Once in a millenia kinda thing.
FR-ben k�thetente megmenti valami a vil�got xD
Yeah, it's just an average Friday night
And it feels so whatever
yeah ez�rt egy nagy industry az adventuring �let
csak ugye m�gsem mindenkinek val�
Ez�rt is van m�r elegem ebb�l a vil�gmegment�s plotline-b�l
Mert olyan sablon, elhaszn�lt m�r egym�s ut�n minden alkalommal, hogy elvesztette a k�l�nlegess�g�t
Base 5e �sszes kamp�nya 9 �v alatt j�tsz�dik le
The world gets almost destoryed 6 times during those 9 years.
Lol
That is the soul of dnd.
But there are campaigns not made around that
Luckily
But it feels so half-assed all the time
Like this one \:D
Just like D&D
And the one that this one ties into. Dungeon of the mad mage
Don't tell me this heist adventure will end as another save the world type thing **again**
Or tell me
These are just get money get rich get magic items and a whole lot of bitches.
Cause then I might just dip
Okay, phew, then let's go
No. Even if you tie this adventure into mad mage you never have to save the world (from what I know)
And that goes to 20
yeah
its just dungeon crawling and
stealing
ez ink�bb ilyen kapcsolat�p�t�d
h�l�kat sz�v�get�s
motoszk�l�s
j�t�k lesz

Become the greatest heroes from the power of... Intrigue and grubby hands? What? In 5e? No way
https://youtu.be/W5WkUoXpwpM?si=k9C4L1cYTUlFY7Ov
No you font have to save the world
Szinte biztos hogy pf indul. Csucsulu az egy nagyon combos kamp�ny amit m�g nem fogok most bev�lallni
Will that start after this?
Side note: i'm guessing we won't host the 0th session today?
Not with Anna missing probably
dont think so
we'll see
But we can meet up if peeps want
I need Nika to help me make that character booklez
I assume alken will be postponed then xd
We'll see how i'll finish today in work
A h�tf�k �ltal�ban nem szoktak kegyesek lenni :)
NA
ME CAN NE ON SESSION
Turns out this week we have 8 hour work days xD
So i can make it to session
*and ye I only found this out now*
:')

Lesz session
Nektek

https://www.youtube.com/shorts/14Cf726r8tk
Yup
So <@334249775652274177> and <@186548078453587968> ?
We have no idea xD
<:blhj:1314710318232113212>
Yea it is very last minute so
It is completely on them if they can / want to or not
Ye just I'd assume it'd be gud to know for u too in time xD
*to prepare*
It matter for me too cuz if I don't have session some peeps might come over
I'm touring Bergen
It would be last min prep anyways
Yea, if you would really need to make a choice always choose the program that is certain
Heya. I am free today, but I also wouldn't mind skipping, if you lot don't mind. I'm not feeling the brightest today, not sure how talkative I would be today.
Aww
I mean skipping would be fine
Yea then let's just skip
Next week is still uncertain tho
I hope I can make it xd
Nem lesz
Should we try to make session be on another day? Only asking since it seems you being able yo attend us always uncertain.
I'm not sure if possible
Just asking hava
I'll get my schedule sometime this week
But ye who knows
I don't think putting it on another day would help unfortunately
:c
So we shall see
Sad
Oki
But this week is fix
So if we put it on another day just this week
That could work
4 ut�n v�rom akik j�nn�nek
Alrighty that is something we can talk about for sure!
Everything else is full for at least one person
Eeeh
Next week tis then
Akkor megyek xD
Good. Wait for Nika. Reg� are you free?
i am
csak kuty�znom kell m�g
Bruuhhhh
�n ma m�r nem megyek sehova xd
�n 5 fele indulok
Too late for me
Nem tudom nektek m�r sz�ltam-e, de estig programom lesz. Ha azut�n m�g ott lesztek, lehet beugrok
Told you guys that she hates me
gay
Not gayer than u
at least im not too gay not to cum
come

any ideas to keep someone entertained on a 7 hour train ride when the person:
- has no interests
- refuses to do anything that requires effort or thinking
- does not like anything that is slow-moving (like a turn based game)
xDD
we have access to a laptop, but no way to have audio to the both of us
Toss em from the train, idk xd
Yeah my first answer would also be "don't"
Just give up xdd
fair
Let them be bored if they don't have ideas
Or like... Anything
wow
yea they are
*a person* for sure
xD
21th century person at its finest xd
A movie you'd like to watch. If they are **so** bored, they'll look
Or ye, just let them be on their own on this one
Hogyha mindent shutdown-ol, akkor ez van
they asked if I could come up with smth, I couldn't so I asked here, maybe someone has an idea
Or you know, you could show them a video you like that has somewhat of a fast pace that still is fun, but maybe doesn't require that much brain power
Do they have a smart phone?
like
2 of them
and a tablet
they just get bored easily
Thats so cringe honestly. Not even just a lighthearted conversation?
Show them a miyazaki movie
Those are usually somewhat long but neat
They aren't that slow paced, maybe occasionally
But looking at it feels good
So takes no brainpower just to sit and watch
I'll recommend it to them
but yea they are just sad
xD
Or you could just show them something else that looks awesome but has basically no plot
a good looking action animation movie
Ah ye ghibli movies
Those are great

*You wanna do a heist in 40+C�?*

WTF
xDDD
that is SCARY like GOD DAMN
The ker�k does apparently
*Super real*
*Be afraid*

oh okay, look I can't research after EVERYTHING I read xD
research = read the poster
xD
***it would be scary like god damn***
https://youtu.be/6hfKt5lVTvU?si=hMAcoWT0_PqFO6_r
me
It's spring or autumn it seems
chilling in the hotel lobby
some kids were eating takeout here
nearly left all the trash behind so I asked them to take it out
to the trashcan
cus
duh
***the kid thanked me in perfect english***
(they were talking norwegian and are def still in elementary school)
they did btw with no issue packed up the trash and put it in the can
Having more time in the dark might help
I don't think that will matter that much
*Cool*
This only generates who our main enemy will be
And the enemy faction
*I like it when I don't have to think about the setup in a heist game*
And important side note, we're not robbers or thieves looting everything. Were on one massive heist, that we know nothing about. Big part of the campaign will be just about finding the thing.
And getting info on it
It's a simple game. It's not concerned with realism.
Of course not everything, that would compromise the mission. But a few small trinkets along the way won't hurt anyone
It's not concerned with thinking
And planning
If not in this then when? xd
I want to exercise my little brain
That's not it. It's a heist adventure in a superhero game so it will run like a heist in a super hero movie.
That's cool
Hungarian kids would have most likely thrown the trash at you for "talking shit".
I think they thought I work here or smth
but still good that they just did it no issue and were nice about it
cus I was called sir and all that
xD
even though I'm in just my usual jeans + sweater
So will someone else gather all the intel instead of us?
Make the plan, and we just have to do it?
Probably not but who knows?
Hope not
That's half the fun
Maybe we get info on it and it has one entrance to it and then we don't have much to plan xD
So weather will be... irrelevant?
*Wow*
I am getting less excited by the minute
Weather is always irrelevant in dnd. I mean almost. We're in a metropolis so it has no chance at affecting us big ways like in other games.
As I said the season we play in decides who our adversary is.
Who are active or inactive during that set time.
It's basically 4 adventures in 1 book
All 4 season changing up the quests we'll be doing, how we do them and who we interact with during
So it might matter, but knowing dnd I don't think we should hope that it will matter too much.
Hm
Buuuut I heard good things of dragon heist so far so for the story I do have high hopes
Set the bar low as usual. Got it
As low as with any other casual fantasy systems.
I know I am nitpicky
And critical
Sometimes it annoys me too
I can't be like I used to be
�n m�r nem tudom mit mondjak r� honestly xd
I get your side of it as well tho. That dnd and dnd adventures never fulfilled your need for realism and complex storylines.
itt m�r senkinem nem j� semmi sem :DD
i get that too
lehet valami story based-ebb k�ne
But this is a "have fun and turn your brain off" game.
I can try even harder to not be a Debby downer. I admit I am a bit more honest nowadays
And adventures are designed around this idea as well (well... Mostly. Some are made stress inducing xD)
Or cynical
XD
Azthittem meghalok hallod

*honesty
It's about not being an asshole
Who brings everybody down
its about how much you can let go xd
Yeah
I guess I should relearn that
you dont?
Well, not that extremely
you just over-analyse things
for no reason
But I understand I can be a bit if a buzzkill nowadays
especially when it comes to something insignificant like a ttrpg
no
At least I sure as hell kill my own buzz a lot
M�rk successfully made Dani wet
youre just constantly overexplaning things you shouldnt be concerned about sometimes
or anyone honestly
<:gobbowhen:1188445136137502770>

It is fun to me, but not for others
Well, not always fun to me either
that might be true :DD
then just take a step back and take a big breath
shake your head and try to approach it from a different angle
I tried
I should just let go
I wish I could be chill again
to show some sympathy
im learning that too
to just
let things as they are
sometimes
It might have been Reg� tho. Doesn't matter much. I did a manly little scream.
God, it would be so good to just be in that zen hippy mindset all the time. Not a care in the world
*meanwhile me who built a reflex to close even the top lid of the toilet before flushing it*
Since I go to the gym I honestly feel so much better in this regard. I let things go much easier, I rarely overthink. It doesn't matter. Not to me, not to anyone else so why should I care? Maybe it has to do with having a lot of unspent energy.
That's basic hygene
Well, I move a lot and I get tired
***but I don't see anyone do it***
You don't want poopoo particles to be around your place
It's just that I like talking about stuff, and I guess I got some reddit radiation
Even though I don't use reddit xd
Well, going back to being a naive wallflower pushover ain't ideal either
I'll try to sort it out someway
I know a few things that need taking care of, and maybe if I get them sorted, I can just enjoy things as they are

I don't know how I could get it
But I'll ask a mod on the pf2 server
H�tha van nekik png-j�k hozz�

There was need for rules on dragging unconcious / downed allies in combat and pf2e is a bit vague on it so here we go:
# Drag <1 action>
[Move] [Manipulate]
You can drag an object, unconscious creature or a willing prone creature within your reach, moving both you and the target. If you use two hands, you can halve the creatures bulk, or use one hand and move them according to their full bulk. You can move the target 5 feet, or 10 feet if you are not encumbered with the target's bulk.

(note that you can still use an action to pick it up and just use additional actions to move with them, but sometimes you just want to more quickly drag something/someone for which this is used)
if ppl agree that this sounds fair I'll add it to our homebrew rules
And what's a creature's bulk?
How much is that for either of us? xD
How would we calculate Angria's bulk for example?
https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2158
+
their carried stuff

Veeery noice
Safe to say, Pyre won't be dragging anyone xD
you can still drag them 5 ft/action if they encumber you
Oooooh
as long as it is not over your max bulk
I misread
Oh
So Pyre won't be dragging anyone xDDD
xD
Sounds gud tho
Thanks, game XD

DM rolls behind the screen would mean that you would only know something happened when it starts affecting your character. Probably the most immersive, but the harshest as well
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
It's either all or nothing, i either know what happens to my character, or nothing at all <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>

Okay I found it
have you found the new one?
cause there is an old and a new

Also. These hidden rolls will be made in a private thread where I will note down what it is for and who's character it's affecting. I'll also have Endre be in the thread to ease anyone's worry about tampering and such. After the campaign comes to an end, I'll open it for everyone to see how things happened. I think this would be the cleanest option to keep the tension of these things alive \:D
(I know some people have worried in the past about such rolls from another DM. Not pointing any fingers.)

*Peak Kereskedelem*
I was planning on doing it that way yes. I'll gather the relevant rules and tables first to have a reference.
# Corruption
**Starting Corruption**: Player characters can start with a limited amount of corruption depending on a few factors.
- *Evil* characters start with 1 corruption point
- Characters searching for their own *Damned Soul* gain an additional corruption point
- ~~If the party aligns with the Deathstalker patron, each character gains an additional corruption point.~~ (Won't be used, as I personally decided to include the Deathstalker questline with every other patron questline. It would be unfair to the team.)

# Temptations 
Throughout the story Asmodeus tries to tempt the characters.

When a character gives in to one of the temptations an additional 2 corruption points are awarded to them. Their corruption maximum also increases by 2, and the needed amount of points to become corrupted also increases by 1. A character can't become corrupted if it encountered 1 or less Temptations. 

-# At the final stage of the adventure, you can tally the scores for each character. Use the Corruption Score table found in appendix E to see if a character has been ensnared by Asmodeus.
Same
Doomsday time in vp south side
Exactly
Im�dom hogy mindig az el�tt hogy �n tanulni akarok xdd
# Infernal Item Corruption
Cursed infernal items can be used by mortals, but they always require attunement. Once attuned, the mortal risks an increasing chance of being corrupted by the item. This corruption starts as pain, infernal whisperings, and delusions, but quickly descends into physical changes, insanity, and an eventual transformation into a devil. In addition to the item�s corrupting influence, these items curse mortals that attune to them. 
- Mortals that receive express permission from Asmodeus, or that make an infernal contract to acquire a magic item, don�t suffer the effects of infernal corruption. 

# STAGE I: BEGINNINGS
- Once a character has attuned to a cursed infernal magic item or artifact, it begins the infernal corruption process. Each time that character finishes a long rest, they must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. (If the character is a tiefling they have advantage on this saving throw.) On a successful save, the character suffers no effects, but the DC increases by 1 the next time they must make this saving throw. **On a failure, the character progresses to Stage Two of their corruption unless the Dispel Evil and Good** spell is cast on the character before they start their next long rest. 
- Breaking attunement to a cursed item prevents further Wisdom saves and resets the DC of the saving throw, if the character were to attune to the item again. However, if a character has already advanced into Stage Two of their infernal corruption, breaking attunement can no longer halt the process

# STAGE II: SUFFERINGS
- After failing the Wisdom saving throw in Stage One, the character progresses to Stage Two. While in Stage Two, they become delusional, seeing plots against them where there are none. 
- Additionally, each time they rest, they experience terrifying visions and infernal whispers. Whenever they finish a long rest, they take 6 (1d12) necrotic damage, which ignores resistances and immunities and can�t be healed until a **Dispel Evil and Good** or **Remove Curse** spell is cast on them. **Once the character has taken this damage from their nightmarish visions six times, they progress to Stage Three of their corruption**. 
- While in Stage Two, the infernal corruption can be removed with one of the following spells: **Divine Word, Heal, Mass Heal, True Polymorph, True Resurrection, or Wish.**

# STAGE III: 
- Once a character�s will has been significantly weakened, they progress to Stage Three. While in Stage Three, the character begins to suffer physical transformation, and slowly embraces evil. After they finish their first long rest upon entering Stage Three they must roll 1d10 to determine how the infernal curse has begun shaping them into a devil. In addition to the specific effects, a part-devil character is rendered infertile and the character detects as a Fiend when subjected to Detect Evil and Good spells and similar magic. (May pick instead of rolling for player ***ASTHETIC**)
```1 - Their fingertips elongate into claws
2 - Non-functional leathery wings sprout from their back
3 - Devilish horns grow upon their head
4 - Each night more and more of their skin burns, leaving charred patches behind
5 - One eye turns milky white, the other turns yellow
6 - Their spine painfully elongates into a skeletal tail
7 - Their skin starts to calcify, turning portions into bone
8 - Their feet painfully twist to resemble cloven hooves
9 - All their hair falls out, replaced by tiny spikes
10 - All their teeth fall out, with new jagged teeth tearing through the gums each morning```
Following their devilish transformation, the character begins to experience waking whispers pushing them towards evil and they suffer terrifying visions whenever they rest, designed to completely break their spirit and push them further to evil.
- Each time they finish a short or long rest, the character must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If the character performed at least one evil act, such as an unprovoked killing of a creature, a manipulative deal, or making a decision that increased the suffering of others, they make the saving throw with disadvantage. When they fail the saving throw, they progress to the final stage of their corruption, Stage Four. 
- While in Stage Three, the infernal corruption can be ended with one of the following spells: **True Polymorph, True Resurrection or Wish.**
Its a sign from the spiritd
STAGE IV: FINALITIES
- After the complete devolution of a character�s morals and will, they progress to Stage Four. When they finish their first long rest after reaching Stage Four, the character�s alignment shifts to lawful evil. They�re now bound by the devil�s code, requiring them to honor any pact made and acquire souls in service of Asmodeus. Lastly, their physical form changes, morphing to resemble a devil chosen by the DM.
- Once the character reaches Stage Four, the only two cures are the **Wish**spell, which counts as beyond the scope of the spell, or by **signing an infernal contract with Asmodeus to reclaim their soul**.

-# In regards to the final stage of the adventure, Characters in Stage Four Infernal Item Corruption count as if they have been ensnared by Asmodeus trough temptations.

# Corruption
*The temptations have real effect on the game, by modifying the amount of corruption for each character. The more corrupt a character, the more likely it is that they succumb to Asmodeus�s manipulations.*

**Starting Corruption**: Player characters can start with a limited amount of corruption depending on a few factors.
- *Evil* characters start with 1 corruption point
- Characters searching for their own *Damned Soul* gain an additional corruption point
- ~~If the party aligns with the Deathstalker patron, each character gains an additional corruption point.~~ (Won't be used, as I personally decided to include the Deathstalker questline with every other patron questline. It would be unfair to the team.)

# Temptations 
Throughout the story Asmodeus tries to tempt the characters.

When a character gives in to one of the temptations an additional 2 corruption points are awarded to them. Their corruption maximum also increases by 2, and the needed amount of points to become corrupted also increases by 1. A character can't become corrupted if it encountered 1 or less Temptations. 

-# At the final stage of the adventure, you can tally the scores for each character. Use the Corruption Score table found in appendix E to see if a character has been ensnared by Asmodeus.
# Infernal Item Corruption
Cursed infernal items can be used by mortals, but they always require attunement. Once attuned, the mortal risks an increasing chance of being corrupted by the item. This corruption starts as pain, infernal whisperings, and delusions, but quickly descends into physical changes, insanity, and an eventual transformation into a devil. In addition to the item�s corrupting influence, these items curse mortals that attune to them. 
- Mortals that receive express permission from Asmodeus, or that make an infernal contract to acquire a magic item, don�t suffer the effects of infernal corruption. 

# STAGE I: BEGINNINGS
- Once a character has attuned to a cursed infernal magic item or artifact, it begins the infernal corruption process. Each time that character finishes a long rest, they must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. (If the character is a tiefling they have advantage on this saving throw.) On a successful save, the character suffers no effects, but the DC increases by 1 the next time they must make this saving throw. **On a failure, the character progresses to Stage Two of their corruption unless the Dispel Evil and Good** spell is cast on the character before they start their next long rest. 
- Breaking attunement to a cursed item prevents further Wisdom saves and resets the DC of the saving throw, if the character were to attune to the item again. However, if a character has already advanced into Stage Two of their infernal corruption, breaking attunement can no longer halt the process

# STAGE II: SUFFERINGS
- After failing the Wisdom saving throw in Stage One, the character progresses to Stage Two. While in Stage Two, they become delusional, seeing plots against them where there are none. 
- Additionally, each time they rest, they experience terrifying visions and infernal whispers. Whenever they finish a long rest, they take 6 (1d12) necrotic damage, which ignores resistances and immunities and can�t be healed until a **Dispel Evil and Good** or **Remove Curse** spell is cast on them. **Once the character has taken this damage from their nightmarish visions six times, they progress to Stage Three of their corruption**. 
- While in Stage Two, the infernal corruption can be removed with one of the following spells: **Divine Word, Heal, Mass Heal, True Polymorph, True Resurrection, or Wish.**

# STAGE III: DEPARTINGS
- Once a character�s will has been significantly weakened, they progress to Stage Three. While in Stage Three, the character begins to suffer physical transformation, and slowly embraces evil. After they finish their first long rest upon entering Stage Three they must roll 1d10 to determine how the infernal curse has begun shaping them into a devil. In addition to the specific effects, a part-devil character is rendered infertile and the character detects as a Fiend when subjected to Detect Evil and Good spells and similar magic. (May pick instead of rolling for player ***ASTHETIC**)
```1 - Their fingertips elongate into claws
2 - Non-functional leathery wings sprout from their back
3 - Devilish horns grow upon their head
4 - Each night more and more of their skin burns, leaving charred patches behind
5 - One eye turns milky white, the other turns yellow
6 - Their spine painfully elongates into a skeletal tail
7 - Their skin starts to calcify, turning portions into bone
8 - Their feet painfully twist to resemble cloven hooves
9 - All their hair falls out, replaced by tiny spikes
10 - All their teeth fall out, with new jagged teeth tearing through the gums each morning```
Following their devilish transformation, the character begins to experience waking whispers pushing them towards evil and they suffer terrifying visions whenever they rest, designed to completely break their spirit and push them further to evil.
- Each time they finish a short or long rest, the character must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If the character performed at least one evil act, such as an unprovoked killing of a creature, a manipulative deal, or making a decision that increased the suffering of others, they make the saving throw with disadvantage. When they fail the saving throw, they progress to the final stage of their corruption, Stage Four. 
- While in Stage Three, the infernal corruption can be ended with one of the following spells: **True Polymorph, True Resurrection or Wish.**
# STAGE IV: FINALITIES
- After the complete devolution of a character�s morals and will, they progress to Stage Four. When they finish their first long rest after reaching Stage Four, the character�s alignment shifts to lawful evil. They�re now bound by the devil�s code, requiring them to honor any pact made and acquire souls in service of Asmodeus. Lastly, their physical form changes, morphing to resemble a devil chosen by the DM.
- Once the character reaches Stage Four, the only two cures are the **Wish**spell, which counts as beyond the scope of the spell, or by **signing an infernal contract with Asmodeus to reclaim their soul**.
-# In regards to the final stage of the adventure, Characters in Stage Four Infernal Item Corruption count as if they have been ensnared by Asmodeus trough temptations.

Today
�n alapb�l azt hittem hatkor kezd�nk
sry
Today
Today
Tomorrow
(unless I sink with the ship)
We can start at 6, but an earlier start would be much much better for my health.
j� h�t csak aznap lenne �gy
And we'll be switching days every month/week either way so
vagyis ugye...k�thetente
de gondolom nem minden h�napban keddenk�nt lesz ugye
<@886672003396927530> is chains not set to weekly on purpose?
giving up after 1 sess?

Because unlike you, people have lives we have to plan around and playdays will be moving every month.

I did set up our other sessions that I know of
Even the biweekly for tails
thank you
No you don't

*The inflation*
Uhmm... random thing, but it humbled me ao fucking much:
I just had a random thought 5 minutes earlier "I have around 130 books right now. Let's count with an average of 6k huf for each, cuz books were expensive. And i also have special editions which are more expensive, so i'll see the end result number and add a little extra for those special editions. I wonder how much i've spent books in the past 2 years."
Uhmmm
Yeah
800.000 HUF i've spent on books so far :'D
-# I have an addiction
Ah xD
Expensive but at least a healthy addiction

Is the life stabaliser a tattoo, or is it a machine like the others?
Did I just get a pacemaker?
The Health Stabilizer is a tattoo, Lifewell Tattoo
But... But... My pacemaker
Pacemaker
Satoru gets a pacemaker
It's canon now
Also
Telefonom Satoru helyett azt akarta �rni hogy S�tor xDDD
I didn't say it doesn't tick in your chest

Random travel encounter?
I'll have to check stuff when I'm not stuck on an airport
Original flight: 1940
Current ***estimated*** 2310
Eeeeeee
That's a lot of years
*Did you join the norwegian military along the way?*
Bro's been waiting since 1940 for his flight
Legend says he's still waiting
Bro survived GTA7

*Egy id�g�p. A v�r� addig mostani �llapot�ban tartja, am�g el mem telik az a p�r �vsz�zad*
They say he lived to see Minecraft 2
Half Life 2
Team Fortress 3

Portal 3
And survived COVID Remastered
The guy aged only on leapyears
They say he waited so long he lived to see his dad return with the milk

*Rayana utols� eml�ke az, ahogy egy pallossal lecsapja a h�h�r fej�t k�zvetlen�l azut�n, hogy b�tyja kiadta a kiv�gz�si parancsot ellene. Nem tudja, hogy testv�re puszta k�teless�gtudatb�l cselekedett-e, vagy tudatosan akarta elt�ntetni az egyetlen tr�n�r�k�st, aki �tj�ban �llhatott volna k�s�bb. De m�r nem sz�m�t. Nem eml�kszik a pokolra � csak a f�jdalomra �s retteg�sre, amit hal�la pillanat�ban �rzett. Azt�n egy er�s f�rfihang kiragadja az �ress�gb�l:*

# �bredj!
*Szemei kipattannak, �s hirtelen minden l�tez� f�jdalom egyszerre has�t bel� � majd egy szempillant�s alatt elillan. �rz�kei t�lterhel�dnek, mintha mindent egyszerre akarn�nak befogadni, de n�h�ny m�sodperc m�lva hozz�szokik a k�rnyezet�hez.
 Egy tekercsekkel bor�tott, gyertyaf�nyes teremben t�r mag�hoz. El�tte egy p�nc�los f�rfi �ll, akinek haj�ba m�r �sz tincsek vegy�lnek. Valahonnan ismer�s neki, mintha a t�volb�l m�r l�tta volna egyszer, de most k�ptelen felid�zni, honnan.*

-Mi?! MI T�RT�NT?!
*Neh�z eld�nteni, hogy ezt most a f�rfi fel� ir�ny�tja vagy csak t�m�let�ben mag�ban kiab�l *

<@875753704685436938> 
Zinzana, amikor �rtes�lt unokatestv�re elt�n�s�r�l, azonnal tudta, hogy valami nincs rendben. Valami t�rt�nt, aminek nem lett volna szabad. Zitha er�s, okos �s �gyes volt, biztosan nem tett volna semmit, ami vesz�lybe sodorhatta volna mag�t� vagyis Zinzana ezt hitte. Eg�szen addig, am�g meg nem kapta a levelet.

A kutat�sa, amelyet Zitha ut�n folytatott, nem maradt titokban. Valaki felfigyelt r�, m�ghozz� nem m�s, mint Zythian Avhoste, Halruaa legf�bb j�sa. A lev�l t�m�r �s egy�rtelm� volt. Zitha lelke a pokolba ker�lt, miut�n al��rt egy szerz�d�st egy �rd�ggel.

Zythian egy csapatot szervez, amely al�sz�ll a pokolba, hogy megmentse azokat, akik sz�mukra fontosak. Vagy �ppen saj�t magukat. A j�slatok mestere �s k�t m�sik �gyn�k biztos�tja a k�ldet�s finansz�roz�s�t, a megfelel� felszerel�st �s a lehet� legnagyobb biztons�got. Cser�be mindh�rman elv�rj�k, hogy a csapat, amelyet �ssze�ll�tanak, teljes�tsen sz�mukra egy-egy feladatot.

Ha Zinzana �rdekl�dik az aj�nlat ir�nt, Halrua�ba kell utaznia. Minden �r �s magas rang� var�zsl� tudni fogja, kicsoda, �s azonnal elk�s�rik a j�sok torny�ba.
(M�r k�sz volt, de m�g meg kell v�rni Bence �s �gi karakter�t miel�tt folytathatjuk. �k is ott lesznek.)

\- Higyje el h�lgyen ha tudn�k ak�rmilyen apr�bet�s cselr�l, elmondan�m. De ez egy egyszer� tranzakci�. Maguknak van odalent valami fontos, ahogy nek�nk is. Mi nem tudjuk elv�gezni a maguk felad�t, maguk pedig nem tudj�k finansz�rozni az �tjukat. Ez a legegyszer�bb megold�s.

-�s mi�rt pont �n? Egy nemesi csal�d gyermeke mi seg�ts�get ny�jthat a pokol legm�lyebb bugyraiban?
\- A rend�nk h�r�t kapta, hogy Neverember �rnak nem csak egy gyermeke volt. A fiatalabbik egy er�s m�gikus k�pess�gekkel rendelkez� h�lgy volt de nemr�giben elt�nt, nemsokkal Neverember �r rejt�lyes hal�la ut�n. Nemsokkal a balesetet k�vet�en pedig egy er�s m�gikus er�vel rendelkez� h�lgyet k�ldtek h�h�r el�. Bemutatkoz�sa pedig al�t�masztotta, hogy a tippem helyes volt. K�rem c�foljon meg ha t�vedek.
-Nem t�vedett! Ap�m nem szerette nagy dobra verni kil�temnek mivoltj�t. Sz�gyellte mi is vagyok val�j�ban. 
*Leh�zza az eg�sz bal karj�t takar� keszty�t. V�r�s, pikkelyes b�re el�rulja szem�ly�nek mivoltj�t*
-Az az igazs�g, hogy amennyiben engem szeretn�nek az �tra, nem csak egy szem�lyt szerz�dtetnek.

*A f�rfi megemeli egyik szem�ld�k�t.*
\- Mire gondol?
*A n� sz�tlanul a padl�ra int. A gyerty�k f�nye t�bb darabra veti az �rny�kokat, de az egyik s�t�tebb mint az �sszes t�bbi. Amint a f�rfi ezt �szreveszi az �rny�k lassan de biztosan elkezd fel� ny�lni. Rayana mindek�zben egyhelyben �ll ak�rcsak egy anya ahogy a gyermek�t figyeli. Amint az �rny�k meg�rinti a f�rfi�t egy gyenge, hideg tapint�st �rez az arc�n a f�rfi mit mikor a feles�g v�gigsim�tja f�rj�nek sebes, puha arc�t.*
*Ramius azonnal h�tra l�p, de nem olvashat� arcar�l f�lelem, csak meglepetts�g.*

*Someone has to save Zitha's ass, and taking into consideration that none of our parents is able to depart for such rescue missions and neither of our siblings is experienced enough for so grave and dangerous adventures, I must take the responsibility myself. And here I was thinking the moron had enough sense and intelligence not to turn to devils to sell her soul. Avhoste's offer however seems way too convenient. A perfectly arranged, sponsored trip to the Hells for us to safely find who we are looking for sounds like a promise that demands a grandiose favour in return. I dare to say these 'tasks' they will ask for will be just as deadly as an unprotected descend to the Hells would be. Unfortunately, I have no better option at the moment, this is the best opportunity I could ever have to get as close to Zithanael as possible. And since nobody else is as capable for the task as I am, I have to be the one who saves her ass. But for that, I have to listen to Avhoste's offer first.*
*I have already discussed the matters with mother and father, but please, look out for them while I'm away.*
*I will try to arrive back in one piece, with her by my side, however I do not think I would be willing to sacrifice my own life for hers. It was Zithanael who fucked up in the end anyway, so if one of us has to suffer the consequences, it shall be the one who fucked it up. I'm willing to do a lot to save her, but I'm not willing to die for her. But don't misundersfand me, I am not running away from death. No. I refuse to die, and I will refuse to do so in fashion. Running away is not the only way one can prevent death, and it is also a lame solution anyway.*
*You know me all too well.*

-Nem... �n vagyok minden egyes mozdult�ban, csak... Van olyan dolog amit nem mondott el szeretteinek vagy a bajt�rsainak? Nekem minden kimondatlan szavam, elnyomott gondolatom nem csak egy b�s eml�k marad hanem benne manifeszt�l�dik. R�szben neki k�sz�nhetem, hogy most ott vagyok ahol vagyok. R�szben meg annak, hogy nem siker�lt megtanuljam, hogy hogyan is tartsam kord�ban. Nem tudok �rte felel�ss�get v�lallni, de igyekszem kord�ban tartani
(So this campaign is the reason why  Zhora will become of the household? /jk)
(Why she becomes the household? Wtf? XDDD)
(*the head of the household*)
(I see xD)
(H�t j�l el�rtad xD)
(I left out 2 words yes.)
(m�r csak Bence �s �gi kell nekem. B�r Benc�nek el�g ha �rok egy hasonl�t mint neked �git meg le tudjuk j�tszani on session. �gyis ti vagytok a legt�bben.)
(Yeeee)
(A boonok fun-ok lesznek majd. Aaaaaa. B�r lesz egy p�r amihez csak p�ran f�rtek majd hozz�)
(Nice XD btw does she sound Lawful Neutral enough?)
(I'm not sure LN would sound any way. She sounds like Zinzana. Sassy but serious. Not sure how that is possible but ye)
(I like to live by the thought "imagine LN as the judge in a court", i think the part whe says "if someone has to suffer for the consequences, be it the one who deserves it" is pretty accurate to this xD)
(But other than than, I'm glad Zinzana is zinzanaing enough xD)
(yeah she feels like herself, even after waiting so long in the fridge.)
(rem�lem a v�g�re is �gy fogod �rezni majd magad.)
("An offer way too convenient". Bro you're the one doing a favour for them mainly. XD)
(Well... xD *perspectives* xDDD)
(We'll see how much you'll corrupt her xD how much she'll still feel like herself by the end of the campaign)
(I'll also wanna ask for some enemies she had earlier in life. Like a nemesis she got rid of some way shape or form)

O.o
Most jut eszembe, hogy most cs�t�rt�k�n nem lesz ucss� �r�m, sz�val 10-t�l m�r otthon leszek.
ooh de j� lenne ha lenne �j e24-es excel sheet
oh me oh my
Hhhhhhhhhh
ooh b�rcsak a beyond olyan j� lenne mint a tacti sheetje
hogy ak�r mit be�rhatok
�s nem kell sz�zezreket k�ltenem hogy a klassz amit akarok benne legyen
Wanna spend your time instead? I'll do it but only if someone does the data entry part
Also I'll need <@886672003396927530> for most of the rule changes mentions and such
i mean, abb�l legal�bb van
She always tries to kill my shoelaces
Alright I can help with that. But I'm not touching the database xD
Azt �lmodtam, hogy a critical role-al j�tszottam.
Vicces volt mert valami basementben j�rk�ltunk, nem mint a karakterem hanem mint siman a j�t�kosok.
Oh meg el�tte valami nagyon fura gazdag csal�d tagja voltam idk, vir�g�ltet�sre eml�kszem mert hogy h�res lettem mert visszajelz�st kaptam Matt�kt�l. Sz�val miut�n beker�ltem besz�ltem vel�k meg megh�vtam �ket vacsor�ra, azt�n a basementben megtl�lt�k a karakterek aki egy....idk, weasel? Ilyen k�gy�-szer�, gy�k eml�s volt.
It was all weird
Meg azt�n megint egy nagy mall-al �lmodtam ahol volt dunkin meg kfc
Meg mozi
Nagyon k�s� volt �s a kfcnek egy r�sz�n ott voltak emberek kanap�n, valami�rt az egyik rokonuk is az �j csaj�val meg valami sz�ke twink.
Na mindegy, i wanted kfc but then i woke up or something
A l�nyeg, hogy most nagyon bennem van a v�gy, hogy CR-el j�tszak, de f�lek, hogy cringe lenn�k meg nem venn�nek komolyan �s megel�geln�nek a j�t�kosok egy id� ut�n :((
Actually
Nekem minden renben van a cs�t�rt�kkel
Nekem nem tudom
A cs�t�rt�k m�k�dik, b�r d�lut�nt�l m�r otthon leszek
Wow
What is happening? XD
That's a dream xD
Nem
Why are we confirming someting that has already been confirmed
To confirm it even yes
megbizonyosoduk, hogy a cs�t�rt�k m�k�dik
de lehet szerel�t kell majd h�vni mert fura hangokat ad ki

Rolled according to the warforged table xD
Remember
Zinzana is Asexual
Lol
Dicegod finds that funny xD
DON'T REMIND ME
XD
FUCK YOU DICEGOD
You can always just
that doesnt mean she cant have romantic feelings for someone
no?
Rewrite the character slightly
Yes btw xD
<:point:951578243415302235>
that would be aro/ace
She's yours, u can do whatever xD
Also ace doesn't mean they can have sex <:point:951578243415302235> <:point:951578243415302235> <:point:951578243415302235>
I'll act according to how it feels with the character, if it feels like it's Zinnie enough, it fine :3
She's definitely more work and duty oriented, workaholic bitch
Yupp
*We'll see* :3
Because it's canon that she redirected all udvarl�-s to her sister in the past xDDDD

But she could still romance
Id say ring or some kind of cloth. Maybe weapon
K�r�ln�zek majd h�tha tal�lok konkr�tat
Never said she couldn't. I'm mentioning it as a joke cuz Nika always said Zinzana would never. But now she might \:D who knows? Nothing is written in stone. Especially not details like these.
No need. Ennyi el�g hozz� thank you
And also
Love is love
If it happens, nothing to do about it
If you fall, there's no turning back :3
The heart is stupid, but the good kind of stupid
Yes. Especially towards a tall metal daddy.
Except when it does
Ah don't even mention goddamnit
Yes, you can always rock climb xD
Hoenstly, i always imagined zinzana to be too busy with family work/practices that she didn't have the time, energy, nor the will to deal with relationships
She's like "sure buddy but lemme pls continue this gods damn spell i'm working on" xDDD

Who knows how it'd go on an adventure, unbound by the duties of the name xD
Character development?
There is more to life than work? Eyo?
In the Nine Hells anything is possible <:UwU:959931778905276456>

what would've been a surprise?
Me being actually here and on time for session

I need to keep a completely different session based on you being here or not xD
cus if we have everyone I have to prep the story
Bocsi
if not I have to prep a filler

*I could just not come then* XD
*definitely a worthy solution indeed*

Or you could just give them this lil' thing and I'll just listen in
nah, dw I didn't start prepping before now
just if you suddenly show up
that's yea, dunno

"The cathedral of Kelemvor is bonecold and dark. The walls and floor are black stone, and there are motifs of grinning skulls in every direction. Deep set into the floor are pools of viscous liquid, as bright and red as arterial blood. The cathedral is still and silent, but you faintly hear the distant click-clack of the bones that hang from the vaulted ceiling, knocking gently together in the musty air."

Jenevere

*The moon elf, idily treads along the walls of the cathedral and plays with the candle flames with his finger as he pass one holder after the other. With a simple flick he puts out one candle after the other as he is circling around the parameter of the temple. His face is as expressionless and empty when he arrived by the side of Sarevok, however, it seems he feels relaxed in the gloomy atmosphere of the building.*
Not a game but pretty cool nonetheless

*The girl, stands around the table and  searches in her bag for anything useful. She takes out some potions, a tome and a cloak. She puts on the cloak on her back then gives the ground a cold stare, but no words leave her mouth. She inspects the tome to make sure that she knows what she is dealing with. As the dark elf passes her by she gives a side look but not too noticeably.*
- I know you! 
*She exclaims with a cold voice*
-I have seen you at Zinzanas party, but i didn't get to know your name. 
*She turns to the elf girl*
-Speaking of... dind't think i'd see you here. Didn't think i'd see you again, yet alone down here.

Ja hogy ez ekkora

No, actually big xd

Sooo... Which two will sleep on the beds in the middle?
One is for the Tiax the Mighty
The captain needs his bed (even if they are just a first mate)
3 of us dont sleep so
We wont have space issues
Oh yeah
Oh wait no only 2.
Zinzana is a damphir
She does need to sleep (I think. We may have agreed on something else with Nika tho)
Ah okay
Well, Mr. GM what do you think, would they still have their trances?
Hm. You told me they are ```Damphir > Elf``` so dunno. Probably not but maybe
Up to you
It was a lore-ish question rather than mechanic
But i don't know, i don't think they'd see stuff, *if* they tranced at all
And I answered in lore-ish yes.
Yeah
They come from the dark elven route so canonically they would only see dark either way.
Yeaahh
I'd love the idea tho that they sleep but they don't need 8 hours, only 4 xD
But that's bullshif, isn't it?
Could work
Instead of 4 hours of downtime and 4 hours of conscious meditation they do 4 downtime and 4 unconscious rest
But only if they become hullamerev during! /Jk
XDDDD
Ahhh butt my workaholic bitch could sometimes sleep more xD
They only need 4. Doesn't mean that they can't sleep more
But we can go any way you'd like. This is so minor it won't change anything. Mainly flavour and 2 hours extra for you to copy spells
Hmm i'll take the "4 hours of conscious sleep and 4 hours of downtime" then xD of course i'll flavour her falling asleep multiple times since if's zinzana-accurate to do so xD and i love a pissed noble woman getting annoyed over her lost downtime to copy spells
Conscious sleep? O.o
Idk what you're talking about <:hmph:1024082067992092862>
Okay alright
*The noble girl's mouth curls into a polite smile when she gets stopped by the Neverember lady. The spellbook she had in hand closes under her fingers, and she hands it over to a pair of amethyst gloves that appear in the air. They take the spellbook, and hold it readily next to Zinzana in case she wants to take the tome back, following her steps as she comes closer.*
� It was not... **my** party, but I was definitely there. I saw you too, Lady Neverember, as well as the kind gentleman.
*She gestures to Austin playing with the candles.*
� It was surprising for me as well to meet here, especially because I never expected to see a Neverember chasing down their own soul...
*Zinzana smirks, showing off her fangs behind her lips.*
� ...But, we all make mistakes, am I wrong? As long as one is willing to learn from such mistakes, there is nothing to judge.
``` A few months ago there were big news about one of the great lords of the Lords' Alliance. Lord Dagult Neverember has been assassinated by a mage who has been executed not long after, by order from the new Lord of Neverwinter, Renaer Neverember, son of Dagult Neverember.``` (Just wanted to drop it here, as nobody seemed to aknowledge what Rayana said to Baalzebul)
*Austin scoffs, listening to the conversation, first, not showing any kind of reaction to the claims about him. As he passes by, he quickly looks both of them up and down and shoots both of them a cold and bemused stare before his mouth twitches into that familiar smirk.* -I dont think so. *And with that, he keeps going with his hands behind him.*
(Yes. Zinzana's words still stand xD)
� Of course not. That gentleman was not an asshole with a stake up in his arse.
*Zinzana bows politely but doesn't lower hed head too far down.*
Noteale npc: 
Austin had a half elf lover who was an archfey warlock of unicorns. She was raised by a dryad after his father left her in the woods and unicorns saved her. Austin manipulated her or perhaps actually fell in love with her, its not clear. 
Austin had a changeling prodigy called Illigen, who he took from an orphanage after burning the place to the ground with his sharran stalkers, killing Illigens 2 best friends in the process, causing him to split his personas into his 2 firends, still believeing they are alive and want to fulfill their dreams they had in the orphanage.
Also idk hogy most akkor vajon mennyi eml�ke van a m�ltj�r�l. Cuz i guess he has some kind of idea who he is and how should he act in certain cituations but idk if he really remembers people or not.
*Rash simply starts adjusting the wraps on her hands, loosening at some part, then tightening on others as she spectates the ongoing conversation*
Dead allies or dead enemies?
A dead nemesis maybe? Would that work?
Erin of Luskan
Oh what? O.o??
Ayomm
Lol
You wish
She achieved everything Austin only dreamed about
OOOOOOO
Mainly total freedom
Burn
LOOOOOOL
Austin: "I cHoSe tO bE a SlAvE, i'D bE tOo PoWeRfUl OtHeRwIsE!!!"
Erin: "Whatever makes you sleep at night old man."
So weird to play someone so delusional ot becomes his reality
Or like...idk if its delusion, thats the case...its always someones reality
Yes
Interesting character for sure
Rash: Noone choses to be a villain
*Austin with crazed eyes*: I did.
Also austin probably really dislikes corellon
I could imagine
Hes like: You want us to be your image? You cant even decide on your own!
Austin transphobe confirmed
Erin: Was an orphan and her main father figure died
Austin: Never had a proper family as the Liadons are meh with their kids
Erin: Turned to the darker side of life
Austing: Turned to the darker side of life
Erin later: "Why am I doing this? It's meaningless... I could be so much more."
Austin: "This is me. I am me. I am who I want to be." /Lies
XDDDDDD
BUT ITS NOT
To him those are not lies. He knows how destiny works and he was like...okay well i guess ill be the bad guy in this life
Ofc later it just proved that he had fallen to the deciete of his own bullshit
And shars
But he was like...yup i guess we are rolling with this until i find i was to create my own proper ending
Or like make the best out of it at least
To him they are not. That doesn't change the fact that they are fundamental lies. He was always who his higherups decided him to be. This is the first time he has an option and he's here with glazed eyes trying to keep it together
Probs.
I just dont want him to be precieved as this lost soul who turned the wrong way at the crossroad
I want him to be fully aware of his choices
Even if at a young age had the edge era or just going around and killing and kidnapping whoever shar needed
Ez m�r a...480-ish austin?
477 originally, but idk about rn
From what I heard about him so far, to me he seems like he might be aware but he never made any choices
Modify memory does wonders to the brain i heard xddd
He was always just along the ride. Like a super depressed superhero. He could achieve greatness unknown to the realms but he never cared about anything enough to actually do more
Shar pro-alzheimers
Yes he saw the flaw in the world and Shar took advantage on that and fed into it more. Showing him how pointless everything is bc from darkness we come to darkness we return
And even in life we are in always just total darkness until we get to places
Tudod "csak s�t�tben tapogat�zunk"
De shar meg azt mondta neki: Lol, nem kell neked, here i give you my blessing to see in the dark. And the dark there is no monster...but you can be one.
He's not lost, he just never had anything
So far
He might find a reason to finally become his own person after almost 500 years of "wasting life"
I like the character a lot
Thats why he wants to fuck everything up and have his own little throne in the hell. Csak ugye akkor �g legyen, hogy teljesen kiesett shar hat�sk�r�b�l �s m�g r�ad�sul lelketlen�l t�bolyog odlent? Well of he is going to cause chaos.
He is like: Well i guess i either get what I want and cause as many headaches as possible, or i die in the process but at least i did what ***I*** wanted to
Fuck this is depressing XD
He is so fucking cool
Honestly hed be the happiest as a slug xdddd
Also eredeti shrotij�ban a blackrazor darabjait kereste, nem tudom azt bele tehetn�nk e a mostani backstorij�ba
(I know that the blackrazor is not shattered, i just wanted something cool)
Lemure timeeeeee
Yup
A blackrazor egy pretty minor item azokhoz k�pest amiket itt tud szerezni
Like
Yeaah
On a cosmic scale it's a toothpick
Cant wait to get my hands on those shards
Meg nem tudom mennyire fura szerinted az interakci�ja a t�bbiekkel.
M�g �n sem tudom, hogy hogyan viszonyuljon hozz�juk
Mert azt nem tudja valszeg beadni hogy t�nyleg nem tud semmit
Meg lehet nem is �rn� meg neki csak akkor meg mennyit mutasson mag�b�l
Shards?
The true ice shards
Oh yeah those
Those are cool
Every artifact is a straight banger
- There seems to be some.. tension here.
*Nym states while staring up at the ceiling with an uneasy look on his face. Despite being metal, he's surprisingly expressive.*
- I've only heard of the two nobles before.
*He gestures vaguely towards the Zinzana and Rayana.*

� You may believe whatever you wish to believe, Sir Liadon.
*Zinzana calls the moonelf by the name he introduced himself as at the Zassricrith ball. She gives him a polite smile, but then she turns to Nym, the little amethyst gloves following her as the noble takes a step forward. A spark of interest glints in her eyes.*
� It is usually my grandmother people have heard of, as I was named after her. I wonder if it's any different with you. Did you hear the legend or the present?
(excellent question xDD)
(coinflip. Heads is the crazed mastermind bladesinger of the past, tails is a young girl who adventured where Nika tells you (I'm not going to spoil it))

(I kinda wish I remembered that before)
(Getting back his soul was his main goal)
(oh well)
(it would be funny hoinestly)
(He left his noble duties as their heir to get freedom, so I guess he kinda betrayed them)
(Yeah)
(I assume she seems too young to be the legend tho)
(She's near 300 years old, she *could* be a legend)
(But then again, all elves look young until the last week of their lives xD)
(With elven looking folk, who could tell)
(but elves can tell)
(Her grandma too looked young when she was a legend)
(fair enough xD)
(It's just elven bullshet xD)
(Fair. Still don't know how they do that if they are basically unchanging after they grow up until they start dying)
(I guess they sense it)

(Going door to door with shiny new stuff and doing cartwheels with blades to impress you)
(*They're not a traveling circus* T^T)
(But they are a bladesinger)
(*The whole thing is they do spells and dance with blades. Am I wrong?* XD)
(fancy-dancy-expensive. Sounds close)

(There's a difference between an artistic fighting style they use to go to war that gives them elegant performances and doing cheap cartwheels to entertain the peasants >:()

-Well I've heard the family name for sure. I assume that was the legend then.

(De vicces lett volna �sszefutni vele azzal az elffel aki miatt annyit szenvedett az on and off romantic interest-je)
� It is definitely on my... *bucket list*, yes. First I must save my dear cousin, of course, but I guess I can work becoming a legend while I'm at it.
*She sighs with a faint smirk*
� I definitely want to "become the next Zinzana", meaning I have to become a legend.
*Rash turns her head towards the Zinzana*
-Oh? The name might have not reached me so far. Please enlighten me. 
*Says with a faint smile*

# Patron Perks:
**HELLRIDERS**
- **Hellrider�s Blessing:** The Hellriders know better than most the evils found in the Nine Hells and would never send anyone there without protection. During every meeting with Ramius, the Hellrider will grant the heroes a Feather of Zariel. Using the Feather as an action, grants the user the effects of a *Greater Restoration* spell.
- **Celestial Cavalry**: While much of the journey through the Nine Hells follows the River Styx, it is likely that you will occasionally leave on excursions or scouting missions. While you remain in the Nine Hells, you may cast the *Phantom Steed* spell at will, as a ritual.
- **Hellrider�s Salvation:** You�re taught a ritual to help save missing Celestials. The ritual must be cast by a good aligned creature and it requires 1 minute to complete and targets all Celestials within 100 feet. Once the ritual is complete, if the Celestial is willing, they�re transported to a location on the Material Plane of their choosing.
CONCLAVE OF HALRUAA
- **Arcane Communication**: The Conclave of Halruaa gives you a Sending Stone and a Halruaan Ethereal Vessel. The Sending Stone can be used to communicate with a member of the Conclave who has the matching stone.
 The vessel is a transparent case that can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). When not in use, it exists on the Ethereal Plane. While the vessel remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and recall it (as can the Conclave member also attuned to it). It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You send the vessel back to the Ethereal Plane by closing it as an action.
- **Arcane Quartermasters**: The Conclave has amassed a collection of useful magic items and material spell components. You can use your Sending Stone to request one of the items on the Conclave Items table. You must then pay the cost of the item, placing the payment in your Halruaan Ethereal Vessel and returning the vessel to the Ethereal Plane. The money is then removed by the Conclave member attuned to the vessel and replaced with the requested item, which you can then retrieve from the vessel.
- *Diviner's Gift**: The Conclave wants the heroes to track down a soul they refer to as the Unmaker. To help with this task and with finding the other souls that the heroes seek, the Conclave offers to use their diviners to uncover the location of powerful magic items. The Nine Hells is the graveyard for thousands of heroes and the magic items that they brought with them. Some of these include the most famed items in the multiverse.
**DEATHSTALKERS OF BHAAL**
- **Death Token**: Each member of your party is given a Token of Bhaal. For its magic to work, the token must be in your possession. The first time you fail a death saving throw that doesn't kill you outright, the token magically transports you, along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying, to a demiplane that resembles an empty chamber with no exits. Any ally within 30 feet of you is also transported to the demiplane, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, if the ally has 0 hit points and is either stable or dying when the token activates. Each creature that appears in the demiplane regains 10 hit points. Any creature that starts its turn in the demiplane is transported back to the space it left, or, if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space. The token can be used only once, after which it turns to dust.
- **Deathstalker�s Blessing**: Your party receives the blessing of Bhaal. This manifests by making you deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn�t taken a turn in combat yet. In addition, any creature that hasn�t taken a turn in combat has disadvantage on saving throws against your spells. The blessing applies only while in the Nine Hells.
- **Soul Coin Market**: Much like the archdevils of the Nine Hells, Bhaal desires souls. Specifically, he desires Soul Coins. When you're in possession of one or more Soul Coins, you can whisper to the coin what it is that you desire from the Deathstalker Items table. If you have the requisite number of coins, the Soul Coins vanish from your possession, and the item that you asked for appears within 5 feet of you.
Perks, boons and quests have been collected in <#1307302532741333044>
I forgot that the soul coin trade isn't trough Sarevok but trough Bhaal himself. XD
Bruh xD

*He asks, tilting his head slightly as he stares unblinkingly at the noble.*
*She smirks a little*
-I did, But at last the bird is freed from the cage and now flies free. 
*the smirk disappears from her face*
-I seen these two, but i cant say the same about you. You guys know each other?

Texas just banned anime and manga that has lgbtq representation in it

Well, Hungary is on the way to ban pride events
the current version of the t�rv�ny*javaslat* (m�g csak be lett ny�jtva) engedi hogy arcfelismer� szoftverrel lek�vess�k az �sszes r�sztvev�t �s el�gg� komoly p�nzb�ntet�s j�r �rte
a Sziget fesztiv�l bejelentette hogy �k le fogj�k szarni a t�rv�nyt XD

Kar�csony is megmondta, hogy lesz pride Pesten, mondjon b�rmit Orbi
*Banning pride events like that would change one's sexuality*
*Ain't noone can stop the gay*
it is in the name of "protecting children" XD
Lol
*But childer won't attend these events??? Hello????*
xDD
Nonono their idea with this is that if you let sick people show that it's okay to be sick, children will pick it up and think it is normal
*looks at the orphanage CEO who was arrested for molesting children and got an official pardon from Viki*
<:yeosangquestionmark:1297933632953909311>
oh you didn't hear about that one? XD

Its the securuty of our families and children
<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
Nika? yes she is
her terminator mode will be engaged as soon as the level of abuse exceeds
The sad thing is that im starting to believe im actually sick xdd
I hate it
*it's like the subliminal and not so subliminal messaging of hateful propaganda against lgbtq people is actually working like it's designed to*
<:blhj:1314710318232113212>
Oh yeah, was he the one who became the orphanage CEO after he raped an elementary school girl as the school district director? There was someone who had something like this going on, a few months ago. (Also connection to fidesz... Duh)
the one I know about is smth from yrs ago
Ah okay. Akkor az valaki m�s lesz. Mert volt most valaki akinek gyerekekkel volt �gye �s egyik gyerekekkel foglalkoz� poz�ci�b�l �tker�lt egy m�sikba.
Cuz you are listening to people who are constantly raving that you're sick.
Looking at anti pride christian youtube shorts doesn't help either.
yea self torture is not helpful lol
Thank god im not doing that anymore
Good to hear
I'm looking for 1 new player for Sunken Isles. Details (please double check session time as it is in a weird time):

Session time: <t:1739977200:F> and weekly afterwards, about 3-4 hours session duration.
System: DnD24
Language: Hungarian
Adventure Type: Light Campaign (expected about 60 sessions +- 50% based on how we'll be playing and whatnot)
Player Amount: 1 slot open

Player's Guide will be posted right below as the first message. So far a few session have passed since and I'll catch you up on the events since.

Apply by dropping an emoji on the post, sending a message on the post, or sending me a dm.

<@377469395007438849> you were recommended by Dani, in case you are interested

https://discord.com/channels/562373378967732226/1351182451531059294
Whaaaa??
<@&1320006468707029063> 
just so you all know Dani has to retreat from the campaign cus he managed to overschedule himself, I'll be looking for new players, suggestions are welcome
but I also made an open announcement
Oh
Thats sad
yea it is, I'm losing my rules lawyer :c
xD
I overcommited to DnD not thinking about my other hobbies and just in general resting and such. Sunken is still in the really early stages, it's easier to bring in a new character and for me to quit.
You can still text me anything. I'm chronically online.
no
we no longer friendos 
hmph
I'll play in next session still, but Kamalani will leave at the end of it.
Also I'm kinda stressed so I'm dropping chai....
some tea gentlemen?
xDDD
/jk 
-# (just in case)
at some point we will just have to peer pressure you into finishing a campaign
xD
Chains is not that long
Also I can play out my sadistic desires
There's my boi

XD
*Holly*
XD
*Zeus wood*
<:idek:694605001502228540>
He sure does
I'm not gonna allow him to drop chains
But sad... i won't able to entertain Kamalani no more :(
I won't
I know :)
Dw you have enough of an audience anyways
I still have a Papa to make his joints crack like a glowstick in his... *joy*
And I'm scouting for a new torture target
I am sick coughing, fever and such. I'll still attend le session me thinks, but if I get worse or just in general don't feel good enough I might leave early
alrighty try to get better
Danke

Murky blue, tastes vaguely of berries - healing

Swirling purple and red, strong peppery aftertaste - strength increase

Sickly green with floating white pecks, thick on the tongue and tastes of grass - res to necrotic dmg

Deep purple with an indescribable flavor that burns the throat - mind reading abilities

Sunset pink with a strong sugary flavor - make you really quick

Brilliant truquoise, sweet but with a salty aftertaste - makes you brave and shrug off hits

Nearly black, with a taste no one can remember - make you very drunk and quite powerful in many ways BUT you can't remember what you did after

Clear liquid with a red bubble that constantly shrinks and grows, easy on the tongue - giant growth

a swirling bright green liquid with specks of turqoise blue floating in it, tasting of moonlight - recharges your magic

Nah of course

I also track and lvl the foundry sheet, tho i don't keep track of the features and inventory there
But lmk if you need an update of my sheet each session/change/lvlup
Tho i think it's only natural to send u an update each lvl up
Exhaustion changed in dnd24 btw now simply it gives -2 to all d20 rolls and -5 to speeds per exhaustion level (still die at 6)

Mivel nem vagyunk 8an �gy egy p�lya el�g ami 7k/�ra
Sz�val nem durva leosztva
Yea 29. szombat m�k�dik nekem

I'd like to play an NPC, sure
Ask him to not make plans for that day, u wanna be with him or idk just be subtle if we wanna keep it a secret :D
I think an Abishai would work for that session. We'll see how long the party gets this week
Sounds good
Dragon devil guards and assorters of the tormented
Yes yes
I love them. Not even Asmodeus has complete control over them.
Which is actually nuts but I digress
And tell him to bring dice cuz you have a game idea. Dunno why he'd bring Rayana's sheet to that but hm
Ha addigra k�sz lesz a dicegod sheet akkor tal�n?

hol �llt meg a csapat?
Ott ahol eld�nt�tt�k, hogy Skati-nak fognak dolgozni
Ez t�rt�nik ha a mentor kihagy egy sessiont
You did this Reg�
xD
le�rtam neked mindent a <#1342042047707873280>-be (kiv�ve ezt az egy dolgot I guess xDDD)
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OMG
i know, damn. i feel so bad :DD i just hate when this happens bc i dont know how to get back the chain of events
can i get some help?
mi�rt is dolgozunk most a bbeg-nek? XDDDDDD
Not much happened in chains yet so you don't have to worry about that
cuz i missed the rps
fuck off
https://tenor.com/view/umaga-wwe-world-wrestling-entertainment-gif-2749268415810119836
hol van most a csapat pontosan?
m�rmint
valami t�bor
vagy �ton?
vagy Makolfban?
cuz i wanna initiate some rps and im just completey lost here
:,DD
Fylkir's Fall alatt vagytok
cus otherwise Makolf will be turned to dust
by these undeads
Oh yeah, the tattoo guys who i presume, explode
On the shore right under/next to Fylkir's Fall
yep, the party made the same assumption
nobody dared to test it though
(understandably)
Imagine just starting a chain reactiom
The annoying ass bitchboy glowed like a gold dragon for a second in his anger in the ruin before we all got out, almost burned Raptor's hands as she was trying to suggest him to get the fuck out of there
Now, on the shore, Kuwe'i sent a message (that you can find in the main channel) to Makolf villagers that we can't go back to the village or else they get wiped from the maps
Telling ya ma boi's POV of the events
Alright pls do
Then we can ingage into some conversations
Uhh i mean that's it regarding of the current events happenning in-game right now xd
Yeah
OH
Okay i get it
The group is currently lost, don't know what to do except not wanting to obey the king's orders
Yeahhh :(
So uhm yeah
early game funzies :3
Other that before, we had a small fight in Keyport with a sparky sparky void abberation celestial whatever crab, found a very tangly rope in the docks, and we sailed back to Makolf
Kamalani knocked the f out Kuwe'i
Because apparently, he was "too loud" or "annoying"
XD
So he pretended to be asleep even after the spell ended, spooked a poor child while the kid was braiding his hair, after that Kuwe'i let Raptor braid his air because it looked like a bird's nest xddd
We ran into another dino on the sea
Took him to Makolf
Okay
Kuwe'i is pissed he couldn't try out Moondew
And Kuwe'i is now visibly sick as all the undead appeared, and he hasn't been better ever since
*A little more from my POV* XD
Okay
Thank you, niggka
No problem <3
Answer chains, i think you might have some unsaid words to the old fuck xd
And the chitchat with the king is in the main channel if i remember right
:)
I also sent him all the readouts that happened during the sesh
--------------------------
*Papa kicsit arr�b a t�bbiekt�l �ll �s a botj�n t�maszkodva szor�tja a nyakl�nc�t mik�zben susmorg� im�t s�hajt az ajkaib�l. L�tsz�lag,  mint mindenki m�st, �t is megviselt�k a napokban t�rt�ntek, �gy m�gink�bb tart�zkod�bbnak �s komorabbnak t�nik, r�ad�sul az �jonnan kapott k�ldet�seik ut�n m�gink�bb zaklatottabb �s ez testtart�s�n �s viselked�s�n is megl�tszik. Farka, feld�ltan csapkod fel-le �s ostoroz karik�kat a leveg�ben, tetov�l�sa mintha sokkal jobban befeketedett volna, szem�nek feh�rj�vel egyetemben, ami par�zsl� fasz�nre eml�keztet. T�retlen hittel besz�l a lelkekhez, akik ugyan olyan megtartott �s szab�lyozott haraggal lengik be a Papa aur�j�t, fel-fel t�r� iszonyattal morogva �s suhogva. Ujjai alatt, nyakl�nca halv�nyan s�rg�s-z�ldes f�nyt �raszt, amin �tcsusszanva ezek a lelkek sokkal �lesebbekk� �s hegyesebbekk� v�lnak, mint apr� peng�k szil�nkai r�gi id�k elfeledett koraib�l. Mik�zben �gy �rv�nylenek �s �j alakot, form�t vesznek fel Kaitiaki izmai megfesz�lni l�tszanak, alkarj�n az erek, d�lledten, harcra k�ssz� pump�lj�k az id�s f�rfi test�t, aki zel�tak�nt egyre hangosabban morolja im�it.*
(morolja lett a mormolja a v�g�n)
*V�gezet�l, toppand m�rhetetlen er�vel botj�val mire a lelkek sokas�ga sebes fordulattal r�vetik megukat a tiefling kez�re �s belesz�llnak nyakl�nc�ba, ami er�s �s t�rhetetlen obszidi�n alakj�t veszi fel.*
(Guys...get ready. The War begins)
So, i heard we leveled up xd. Time for war cleric
Not us, thinking its gonna be a peaceful campaign where we sail around island to island, hapily building our minecraft village and trade with the locals....god damn
(Am�gy nem tudom ki az a Tina ne k�rdezz�tek...)
ChttDrr v�lem�nye szerint lehet fell kell �ldozni a falusiakat, a sziget �sszes lak�j�t, �nmagunkat bele�rtve a l�zad�s folyam�n, ha az azt jelenten�, hogy Fylkir sosem tudn� elhagyni a helyet.
Persze ha az utunk sor�n tal�lunk valami jobb megold�st, akkor vev� r� hogy ne kelljen ehhez folyamodni
A t�bbiek meg t�ls�gosan szentiment�lisok ahhoz, hogy egy�ltal�n gondoljanak erre az opci�ra
Skati meg felaj�nlott nek�nk 2 m�gikus t�rgyat �s egy spell tekercset
( <@282869456664002581> do you like it? Does this effectively make up for the lost rps from session? Did i catch up with the other players? Xd)
De elutas�tottuk
Mi volt az a staff?
Asszem mondta Endi ut�na, de ingame nem tudjuk mert r� se n�zt�nk XD
Nem eml�kszem milyen bot
*The short elven noble dances closer to the moon elf, the amethyst gloves closely following her behind with her spellbook raised into the air. The girl's bloodred eyes glint with unamusement, nodding to Rabid Dog's brief story.*
� I may as well treat you either as a rabid dog, or a lifeless object then, Sir Liadon. However, I see not why you are acting so... *distant*.
*She breathes the last word with a held-back urge of wanting to say something else.*
� I believe we have not treated you as a cockroach...
-# � ...just yet...
*She adds in a low voice, but continues as though nothing's happened.*
� ...to have earned such nonchalant, disrespecting treatment from you.
*Zinzana faces the Dog unphased and respect-demanding, holding eye contact fearlessly, her piercing gaze speaking the unspoken fact that she tolerates many things, but disrespect is not one of them.*
*Not waiting for his reply, she steps back and turns to walk away, but she still adds one more thing over her shoulder before making her way back to the rest of the party.*
� I do not care about your story, but I do care about mutual respect, which I do not sense coming from you. Don't expect my respect until then, Sir Liadon.
Staff of the Python if i remember right
Oooooh
(God dayum)
(I'm sorry :'D)
(Ill wait for the others answers if there is any before i write a reply :33 oooh she feisty)
(Ahhh she is xD there are ways one can trigger her xD)
(Also papi lesz az els� aki megnyitja a nether port�lt a kamp�nyban)
(What did she find so desrespectful tho?)
(Hiy general ignorance?)
(Achievement Unlocked: *We Need To Go Deeper*)
(Mhmm)
(Yes)
(But it has a background)
(She knew someone else in him too)
(That changes her perspective)
(Otherwise, she probably wouldn't be so triggered)
(If she never knew he "can be respectful and kind", she probably wouldn't even care xD)
*A mant-i �rtetlen�l figyeli amit a Papa csin�l. Csak annyit fog fel bel�le, hogy a szellemekhez besz�l am�g azok bele nem sz�llnak az �kszer�be, meg ideges, mint mindny�juk. Odabilleg az id�s �rhoz �s sima kez�vel meglapogatja a h�t�n l�v� viselet�t, hogy mag�ra vonja a figyelm�t.*
- Mitt mondtt�l nekkikk? Seg�ttenekk nekk�nkk?
(Why do you think she refers to him by the name he introduced himself as back then? :D)
(na majd a pokol helyreteszi a gyereket)
(XDDDD)
(Na majd a pokol helyre tesz mindenkit)
oh my god actually that looks so good
so sad papi cant stand without his cane for long xd
*Kuwe'i ahogy mag�ban r�g�dik �s ism�t felh�zza mag�t, apr� spiritek gy�lnek az �kl�be amit egy frusztr�lt ki�lt�s sor�n, egy infinitely �les penge form�j�ban a t�volba haj�t, k�zben jobb szem�b�l egy feh�r, ghostly l�ng gyullad ki ahogy ezt mind megteszi. L�that�lag egy pillanatra meg is lepi a jelens�g, de hamar elfeledkezik r�la ahogy a homokba huppan, megfog egy kavicsot, �s a tengerbe haj�tja mindenf�le sz� n�lk�l. Majd m�gegyet. �s m�gegyet.*
� Rem�lem ez az ima megmenti a falusiakat...!
*Mormogja az orra alatt, ink�bb mag�nak mint Pap�nak, amint a tiefling befejezi a k�nt�l�st.*
He could use the staff as a cane, no? But the real question is
Would he accept it from the king? <:sipsmmm:1138914815172169901>
(woah, why he mad?)
probs not
also
the staffs turns into the python no?
yeah, it does
(Undead everywhere, he can't do shit about it and their presence makes him sick. His village and loved one got threatened and he can't do shit about it. He's frustrated my baby poor boy)
It's turns into the pythongirl
OH
<:gasp:955912700175736842>
*R�pillant a huszon�vesre. Antenn�i merev �ll�s�b�l le lehet sz�rni, hogy ez a kis tombol� jelenet csak m�gidegesebb� teszik �t is. Az�rt �rdekesnek tartja, hogy ism�t dob�lja a kavicsokat, �s most meg se k�rdezi egyiket sem, vagy v�r valamennyit, h�tha valamelyik v�laszol.*
- Hi�nyzikk Kkamalani... *Gondolja. Egyed�l �rzi mag�t ahogy itt maradt a k�t forrong� melegv�r�vel,... de ott van Smite Well, aki m�g mondjuk eg�sz higgadt ebben a helyzetben.*
- �lljunkk ttov�bb. Mostt bizttos gyorrsan tudn�nkk haladni, amilyen forrm�ban vagyttokk. Hamarrabb ttal�lhattunkk valami megold�stt, mintt itttt �cs�rr�gve.
*Papi lepillant Chttdrrra, szemei m�svil�gi nyom�ssal tekintenek le a kis r�kemberre. Arckifejez�s�n l�tszik, hogy �rz�keli a fiatal harcos k�nyelmetlens�g�t �s b�skomoran vesz egy halk s�hajt, hogy lehiggadjon, �m szem�ld�ke hamar r�ncosodni kezd mikoris nem meghallja a k�vek folyamatos, s�rt�, sokszoros csobban�s�t a tengerben. Sz�ra sem m�ltatva a helyzetet �s Chttdrr javaslat�t, csak hat�r�zott hanggal feld�rd�l �s a k�zdeni k�v�n� lelkek egy �j l�ngot keltenek fel benne, ami a m�lyr�l j�v� parancssz�ban nyilv�nul meg.* -Mutu!

*M�r �ppen nyitn� a sz�j�t Kuwe'i hogy v�laszoljon Chttdrr-nak, de Papa hirtelen ki�lt�s�ra �sszerezzen, �s kicsit �sszeh�zva mag�t r�m�lten �s zavartan, elkerekedett szemekkel b�mul Kaitiakira. M�g a kavics is amit k�vetkez�leg dobni akart a mark�ban ragad.*
*Nyel egyet, majd elhaj�tja azt a kavicsot, de nem vesz fel �jat. Helyette vissza�l a fenek�re �s a homokba markol, gondterhelt tekintet�t a tengerre emelve.*

K�pzeld el ha valaki egy +1-es fegyver�rt hajland� lenne szolg�lni fantasy blood mage Hitlert
I mean
u guys gonna serve him *without* getting a weapon in reward
If we can erase this bastard from existence, sure, but only after that
not even reward, gift
Vagy ha am�gyis elszakad
�s azzal kell �jra megk�ldeni

(Oh my. Fucking god. God damn omg damn)
I told Endre that Kamalani would probably have taken it
(Damn)
(El kell valahogy menn�nk a f�ldes n�ci�rt)
To him Skati seems like way too up in his ass to mske it a trap or something. Taking it is just making our side stronger
(Vagy csak unrelated event)
*Ha meg tudn� r�zni a fej�t, megtenn�. Persze neki sem tetszik a kavicshajig�l�s, de nem hi�nyzik neki ez az agressz�v papol�s sem. Locsognak �s nem tesznek semmi hasznosat.*

(soon, we will be going but this has been long due xd)
ChtDrr csak nem akar elfogadni semmit egy zsarnokt�l
Csapd�ra � sem gondolt, amikor felaj�nlotta
bazdmeg
Egyszer�en csak doesn't want to do anything with what he has to say, or offer
beyondon csak life clericet lehet kiv�lsztani
uuuuuuuuuuuuuugh
(yea Chttdrr is for the fight, no fight no good)
(papa hozza a csal�dj�t)
time to get back to filling out that google sheet ;)
- Ha a probl�m�kkatt akkarrjukk megoldani, menj�nkk verrekkedj�nkk, ne veszekkedj�nkk...
(sorry, pr�b�ltam nem t�l len�z�re meg�rni, nem tudom mennyire er�s, lehet m�g ki kellett volna eg�sz�tenem valamivel...)
yeah
i suppose, yeah
(ChttDrr has no need for angst)
(Except when they lose at ahandstand competition in peace times. That's tragic)
i might have went overboard
but i thought that these new spirits kinda bolstered his anger a little bit
so he is more assertive then before
but i hope you like the wording
yea, going well, you can tell the translation to the Primordial talk to Nika cus Kuwe'i speaks it too
sure
its just a prayer but i can send her
just so she knows :D
fun tidbits :D
*Kuwe'i ugyan visszasz�l�s n�lk�l v�gig t�ri a dorg�l�st, de minden pillanat ut�n egyre jobban felmegy benne is pumpa; test�ben minden izom megfesz�l, feh�r szemei felvil�g�tanak, �s a b�re a kezein aranyl�n izzani kezd. Papa sz�noklata ut�n �lesen besz�vja a leveg�t, �s felmarkol egy kavicsot miel�tt fel�llna a homokb�l.*
� Igen? Komolyan ez a legnagyobb probl�m�d jelenleg, hogy kavicsokat hajig�lok?
*Ahogy a kezei vil�g�tani kezdenek, �gy egy aranys�rk�ny szarvainak sziluettjei is megjelennek koron�t alkotva a manaki feje k�r�l, majd a k�vet amit eddig szorongatott megmutatja Pap�nak, majd azzal a lend�lettel a tengerbe haj�tja. Visszafordulva a sr�c rettent� d�h�s arc�n m�r foly�kony, arany f�ny folyik v�gig a szemeib�l, a sz�j�b�l �s a f�l�b�l, �s rettent� er�s h�hull�m csapja meg a t�le nem messze �ll� Pap�t.*
� Azt hiszem jelenleg enn�l nagyobb probl�m�ink is vannak! Nem mehetek vissza az otthonomba, ki tudja lehet soha t�bb� nem fogom l�tni a csal�dom! A szigetet el�nt�tt�k az s�t�l� hull�k, a gyomrom is felfordul t�l�k, �s visszaj�tt a hal�lb�l egy kir�ly aki azt �ll�tja hogy k�t m�sik legenda is visszaj�tt a hal�lb�l! �s ezekkel a legend�kkal akar �j kir�lys�got faragni!
*A foly�kony f�ny szab�lyosan sercegve �geti Kuwe'i arc�t.*
� �s komolyan az a legnagyobb baj, hogy elhaj�tottam tizenk�t kavicsot az elm�lt �t percben?
(Stop it, no, it's absolutely perfect i love it <a:AAAA:1094704045878427769> )
(wait)
(did he hit him with that sound wave?)
(Heat wave, but unless he's within 10 feet of him, Papa take 2 radiant dmg)
(in case he is within 10ft?)
(not unless, ye?)
(Sorry)
( well 10 feet is a lot :DD and he go pretty upclose and personal as i wrote)
(Yes yes, fair :D)
(Then 2 radiant dmg)

("Senpai" is how japanese student girls call their male seniors btw xD)
XDD
i mean he would have just started to haka dance towards kuwei
still could have blamed it on the fighting spirit
also those were the spirits of warriors
if
that makes sense
(I do know that one)
yea, I got what u were going for XD
i hate dnd beyond
UUUUUUGH
(I love causing mayhem)
xD
btw
is that right that Kuwei still does not understand what Papa is trying to say to him,
(This is like the tension release after the mayhem these two interacting causes XD)
or is papa being too stoic and
idk
I think it's like
a bit too stoic, but still easily within reason for an old man
xD
also btw, u were not there, but out of game I mentioned, when those stones talked to Kuwe'i
they were Dani spamming subtle spell minor illusion
xDDDD
alright. but do you get what im trying to convey here? XD like...kuwei just repeatadly made the same mistakes over and over
oph
god damn
wait
akkor
ez most
xDDDDDDDD
wait
what?
technically

throwing stones around is fine like who cares
xD
it was just Kamalani trying to get Kuwe'i in order
xD
oh so papa is also just delusional xd
I mean a local said so
it must be true
xD
sure
also
papa is an outsider who has a weak connection to the spirits
never really talked to them
m�r ha lehet vel�k
lehet
b�r szinte mindig ritu�l�kon �t
an�lk�l csak special circumstances
pl mint most a subclasshoz per say?
ahh
BUT THAN WHAT IS GOING ON RN???
keep in mind:
- immortals cannot act by themselves
only half immortals
so this means someone is manipulating them
or the water
was it kamalani again?
oh, okay
but cant respond to danger or like disturbance?
or commotion
Kamalani Makolfban lel�pett mert Kia'i-k vissza h�vt�k a Living Wall-hoz (ami ott van a kil�t� alatt basically), hogy azt valami furcsa l�nyek t�madj�k n�ha n�ha �s kell t�bb ember a patrollokhoz
nop
ah okay
weeeellll
hmmmmmmmmmm
ugh
papa is getting senile and blind
like
i failed everything in order to correctly respond to the situation xd
the perception was like
you can't really see shit well when you are about to get impacted by a huge ass wave
xD
true
and nature is just..papa is not good with that i guess
*Miut�n a hull�m Kuwe'it a f�ldre ter�tette, minden aranyl� f�ny megsz�nik r�la, a sr�c pedig elkerekedett szemekkel, lesokkolva t�ntorodik k�ny�k�re t�maszul ahogy a tengerre b�mul. Pillanatokig meglepett, r�m�lt �s ijedt arccal mered a messzis�gbe, megmozdulni sem mer, a leveg� is a mellkas�ban ragadt. Mintha nem is venn� �szre hogy Kaitiaki is ott van.*
*Majd hirtelen j�n a felismer�s, l�gz�se s�lyoss� v�lik �s majdnem �jra elter�l a f�ld�n ahogy az el�bb t�rt�ntek realiz�l�dnak benne.*
� Quing...?
*A n�v halk mormog�ssal j�n ki bel�le, aminek hallat�n egy felszisszen�s k�s�ret�ben a tenyer�be temeti alacsony fok� �g�si nyomokkal bor�tott arc�t.*
not *that* at home with some of the more hidden history of the isles
yeah
makes sense
(huh, thats new?)
(peeps can make a history check to see if they know the name)
-r 1d20+1
bezzeg ezt tudja
-# (mmmmm yes i love when a god complex guy gets humbled mlemlemlemlem)
Quing is a gold dragon half immortal
his domain is Death and Decay
was an ancient gold dragon who protected the isles but died during the war against Skati
<@520697326679883808> 

scouting k�zben csin�lsz b�rmi extr�t?
aaah
now things make sense, huh? XD
yeah amir�l asszem volt sz�, hogy Kuweiben van
vagyis legal�bbis azt hiszi
vagyis hogy
� az immortal
probably �gy m�r leesik Pap�nak hogy a kett� be�rkez� hull�m/sz�ll�k�s el�gg� olyan sz�gben volt mintha sz�rnycsap�sok tett�k volna
ooh
i seeee
ok�
(Gondoltam a k�z�s rp csatorn�ba �rom)
so does this mean its a spirit?
or like
his spirit or something?
Half immortals have their immortal form which is in this case simply the concept that things die and decay
And can manifest a mortal form in the right circumstances which can do mortal things like influencing immortals
Yea aszerint hogy milyen messze m�sz ofc
so
what seemed to trigger this?
the island is decayind? XD
(amit m�g elfelejtettem: ) 
*R�gt�n a megsz�lal�s ut�n olyan �rz�se t�mad Kuwe'inek mintha valami nagyon er�s ott a tenger felett meghalna majd szinte azonnal el is bomlana.*
Decay was always present, it's part of the cycle
(de nem l�tni semmit ha oda n�z sem)
https://tenor.com/view/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa-angry-gif-24385107
so
i think i get it
but not quite xd
Circumstances-t itt el�gg� neh�z rajonni

De p�lda, ez nem teljesen igaz �gy, mert nem tudtok ugye mindent de seg�t hopefully mert ez �gy teljesen lehets�ges:
Kadaur
Egy half-immortal ugye
Alapvet�en � maga a sziget

Kit�rt a vulk�n �s Makolf bajba ker�lt, �gy megjelent a mortal teste Kada, hogy megv�dje a falut
Kadaur, az immortal form�ban csak akkor tud tenni b�rmit is ha egy mortal "felk�ri" r� egy ritu�l�val vagy m�gi�val
De Kada, aki basically egy mortal body
Az tud ritu�l�kat �s m�gi�kat haszn�lni
Thus el� tudja hozni az immortal form�ja erej�t (meg m�s immortalok�t is, mint egyszer� k�vek vagy ilyesmi)
---
Ez �gy seg�tett?
A dzsungel s�r� aljn�v�nyzet�t �gy t�rja sz�t maga el�tt, mint m�s a f�gg�nyeit. A f�kr�l cs�ng� ind�kat �s azok k�z�tt rejt�z� kis k�gy�kat, �llatokat is hasonm�d pr�b�lja t�vol tartani szemeit�l. Igyekszik felm�rni, hogy melyik �tvonal fel� nem kell l�pos talajjal, vesz�lyes n�v�nyekkel, �llatokkal sz�molniuk... igaz, nem nagyon tudja, hogy a felsz�niekre mi jelent vesz�lyt �s mi nem, meg azt�n � is csak most van el�sz�r a sziget m�lyi vadonban, de legal�bb csin�l valami hasznosat, �s tal�n megtud valami �jat. Esetleg szerezhet gy�m�lcs�ket is, vagy tal�n tal�l valami men� helyet amir�l � is mes�lhet majd otthon miut�n Fylkirt olyan foly�konyra verik, mint a teremt� isten v�re.*
Oooh ok�
So its a channel
(Nem t�ls�gosan, de nem is csak p�r m�terre)
(Ink�bb csak egy areal "scan")
So the concept of death just created a mortal thing that manipulates the immortal spirits of the water?
(Nem hosszra megy, hanem egy sz�lesebb ter�leten)
Yea
And probably in accordance to the domain it just died and decayed instantly
*Papa nem sz�l semmit csak vissza egyenesedik �s hagyja, hogy Kuwei feldolgozza mag�ban a t�rt�nteket.*
Ah i see
(*H�tha �sszefut az �ri�s flaming�kkal �s meghal* XD)
So basically papa represents the resiliance and strong will of the manaki people?
Or like morale of the spirit
And he channels that through his amulet
That he uses for magic
Persze papa nem half immortal
Papa is simply a mortal, a mortal who knows how to channel/manipulate/whatever you want to call it the immortal to help him in his journey
Which is his fighting spirit the island help him manifest
(spirits are also immortals here)
These spirits are around but they can only manifest through Papa's rituals/spells/etc.
He enables them to truly fight for their islands
With his holy symbol
And his actions
Yes
Okay, i get
(The shrimp lords will attack the shrimp)
Sz�val kuwei spirit bladej�hez is kell valami?
(Anna egy survivalt dobj majd)
Kuwe'i's actions
Summoning them is a very minor and really quick ritual basically
So papa wouldnt really need a holy symbol to be able to cast
You only need it for some rituals/spells (the ones with material component)
Damn, like i never played dnd....also whats with his surge?
Kuweis
As in?
His aasimar surge
Just the effect of the gold dragon?
The boi does have some of his own power he carries a blessing according to Keawe
Alright.
Are we actually going for keelhaul first?
Kuwei is really on a bloodthirst
You only need to retrieve one of the legends
Kumuhea is underground
Keelhaul is underwater

The Anna was like "yea we can't breathe underwater so we should go for Kumuhea" but there wasn't any real decision yet
The party just kinda nodded and it was close to session end anyways

mondan�m hogy probs Sunkenben menne a legjobban a teszt de te nem vagy ott XD
I don't even have a camera for my screen
nem valami megfizethetetlen honestly XD
tel�r�l vagy g�pr�l szokt�l lenni dc-n?
amikor session van?
G�pr�l, legt�bbsz�r
Kiv�ve amikor ki kell ugranom a mosd�ba, vagy a konyh�ba kaj��rt
mert am�gy ha van �lv�nya a telefonnak akkor azt is sim�n tudod haszn�lni
Nincsen
rip xD
I guess I could make a makeshift stand for it
Or just hold it in my hands if I'm on the phone
yea but holding it in your hands for like
3 hrs xD
is not really an option I think
Is no issue
it just sounds crazy when you could just have a stand
Ink�bb az lenne bajos, amikor k�zben n�znem kell a dolgokat, �rnom, meg zen�t hallgatni sem tudn�k tel�r�l, mert a VC elnyomja az egy�b m�dia hangj�t
<@&1209957580164702270> 
I have been playing in a campaign for a while where we have webcams on during the sessions which turned out to be quite fun
Just as an idea, how would the peeps feel about trying a session with webcams and if it works then we can go with it from then on?
(I will obviously not force anyone to do it or anything like that, just an idea as I said)
�n am�gy laptopr�l vagyok �s k�t fi�kkal kell mert besz�lni g�pr�l besz�lek �s a secondary discordom a kamera xDDDD
wonky ass setup but works
<@&1320006468707029063> 
Egy kb h�napja j�tszom egy campaignben ahol kamer�val j�tszunk �s honetly el�gg� fun l�tni a reakci�kat meg ilyesmi
Kis v�lem�nykutat�s szer�en mit gondolnak az emberek egy session-t kipr�b�lni kamer�val hogy milyen?
(ofc nem k�telezn�k r� senkit, csak egy �tlet)
�n m�r r�g mondtam, hogy sokkal funabba lenne
�n benne vagyok
Fine by me, csak akkor be kell szerezzek egy webkamer�t :'D
<:sipsmmm:1138914815172169901>

*Tch, always*

For a moment I thought this was some Avatar the Last Airbender wallpaper XD
it is
duh
XDDDD
xDDDD
Kuwatar the last bitchboy
vagy az vagy egy m�sodlagos discord amit kamer�hoz haszn�lsz valami mobil eszk�zr�l xD
I have another version, but i the previous better
You mean use already existing tools to do the job instead of buying the specific one? Eww
MY FUCKING GOD ILYEN DR�G�K A JOBB MIN�S�G� WEBKAMER�K?
nem kell semmi ami t�bb mint simple HD
sz�val
kb 2k forint
nem kell semmi m�s csak egy sima hd vide� bel�le
I don't have cam on da puter xd
But this Monday I'll only be able to join from phone anyway xD
There are ways to get around it
an HD cam is about 2k huf
making a secondary discord to have the phone cam as a camera account is free (I do this with my laptop)
(I think u can continue tbh)
I see xD
but as I said if it is too much trouble or you don't want to, that's fine
If I get a camera I might as well just get some *disposable income* on the side as well xDD
(jk)
<:UwU:959931778905276456>
Flexing I see
I mean some side hobby with the boyfriend that *also earny some income*

Lehet k�sek cs�t�rt�k�n
Probably Benc�vel egy�tt akkor ha elk�s�r
Oh yeah question, will we have a session this Monday? I am free just asking to know!

*His smile gets milder while listening to the young noble and he does nothing of that requested mutual respect but keeps leaning against the pillar. To add more wood to the fire, he crosses his leg, one before the other and scratches his ear, grimacing in slight annoyance by Zinazana's forced bravado.
-Oh, why, thou art me a great deal of pain, Lady Zassrichrith! How come thou bestow me with thine strong disapproval for something that I have not commited? *Its clear that he adopted Zinzanad eloquent tone of voice as mockery to her overly nobleasque behaviour and empty threats.*
Oh
Not..Zass-ric-rith?
Nop
That where I mess up saying it as well

But elvish is just french on steroids so it needs to be weird
They royalty? I thought they were just nobility
They might have been royalty when the name first started
We can never know what they were in the dark elven ages
*Just as Zinzana promised, in absolute absence of respect, she doesn't even care to turn back, not even react to the moon elf's mockery, as though the male didn't even exist to her in the first place. Her neutral, faint smile of politeness rests on her face as she retrieves the spellbook from the amethyst gloves, and returns studying it in a quiter corner, far from Rabid Dog.*
(Rabid Dog, Male wow)

time to prepare for robo wars
Robots are too expensive, humans are a cheaper resource for being a footsoldier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy2zcNn0oE
*All three of the damned souls feels a slight sickness creep up their throats. Their vision starts to fade for but a second, as they see slight vision from their peripheral vision. Rayana can hear metal clanging in the distance and red hot metal around her. Austin smells rot and bile with a sickened world in his vision. Nym hears very little, just a distant crack in the ice, but he does feel the stinging frost as it tries to freeze him to his bones. They start falling to the ground, but before they would hit it, a painful jolt rips trough their spines, waking them up to reality.*

Time: <TBD>
System: City of Mist
Language: **Hungarian**
Adventure Type: Oneshot (maybe twoshot cus u know... XD)
Player slots: 4 (people who didn't play it yet will be slightly preffered)

# What is the City of Mist?
The City of Mist is a roleplaying system built around comics style investigation and action. One of the main differences from our usual systems is that there is no separated rules for combat, it is simply just roleplay as everything else.
It is set in a modern metropolis rife with crime, conspiracies, and mysteries. The protagonists are **Rifts**, ordinary people who became the living embodiment of a legend, their **Mythos**. While your Rifts may seek to strike a balance between the mysterious nature of their Mythos and their mortal aspirations, the powers within them always threaten to tear their lives apart. They have unwittingly become a part of a secret world of clashing stories, and soon other legends will come looking for them, with demands.
In the game the players form *The Crew*, a group of investigators who found each-other through them being able to see through The Veil (aka being Rifts with some Mythos connected to them).

# Disclaimer
I'm not at all good at running this system, I *suck* at running roleplay heavy things, but I still really like the system and want to show it to people.

# Demons in Cross End
The crew has been approached by Michel Ahmagi, the owner of the Ananda art gallery. According to him a trained professional broke into the gallery and stole several items, but the only one Michel truly cares about is an item loaned from the city municipality, the schematics of an old church. He doesn't want to report it to the city, hoping that this incident can be solved smoothly if he pays the right people the right amount, that being you, and quite a lot.
mostly calling on the new peeps I didn't run this system to: <@875753704685436938>, <@886672003396927530>, <@377469395007438849>, but if there is enough ppl I don't mind it running twice

I could definitely give it a go
Btw this is like: 90% of the rules
this is like
90% of the rules XD
Ye xD
Choose a myth u like, make a character around it, easy UwU
Or just, play pre-made, they are really cool
But I know, that's hardly an option xDD
I'm lil confused because of the missing info but i'm guessing it's not that hard xDDDD
(like, what's a myth, where does power points come from and what are they)
a myth is like
loki
the excalibur
etc, etc
anything that is not historical fact but has some kind of story/legacy
this is how your character sheet looks like
and you see there are those power tags, if one of them fits what u do
you get a +1
xD
that's it
if one of the weakness tags from the bottom fit it, you get a -1
(yes, ofc I choose the Kitsune to showcase how a pc looks)

Gandalf the beast barbarian
xDDD
Meg a Szotyi �s a Zizi
arent they dead?
Valamikor j�tszunk m�r egy DnD j�t�kot az �llatainkkal
sure
�gi rajzolt is Szotyihoz warlock k�pet csukj�val, meg l�ngokkal a szem�ben
�n benne vagyok
igen nekem is az jutott eszembe
Which one do I choose?
Your favourite :'D i dunno
I don't have that
Then the most iconic
But we have to wait until i move and get another cat so Dani can play Gandalf
I could play the Prince but he wasn't my kitty
:(
I'd say getting shot on the side with a shotgun, crawling your way back from the forest to the house and then surviving with no visible scars is truly something
Wow
But Palika has passed years ago
i mean
they were lovers so
*One sided terrorism = love*
I don't wanna play a couple in a game with my ex thank you xD
you...dont have to im just saying
Ye i know xDDD
i meant like
cuki was pretty much a family member
He was also singing along with the harmonica
Awww baby
It sounded awful XD
Yes i agree
But so did our harmonica play
xDDDD
We also had like 10+ cats at one time, and another dog, and another cat, and two hamsters
Okay yeah fair, I could play Cuki
But I don't think those count
They were before the gang
�
Yeah maybe
???
oh
the 10 cats
10+
ok
Jacky would be... rogue maybe
or a bard
jackie is an anxious wizard or sorcerer
He likes to bark at others even though he would probably die in a fight with them
big yapper
What would Cuki be?
Palika went toe to toe with a big german sheperd hybrid and was okay
He was a tank like that
nem bard volt?
Dug himself out of the garden whenever he could, went to the neighbour to steal chickens, then gut them in our garden
Murder hedgehogs
I mean, he was charming, but idk if he'd actually be a bard
I think he'd be more of a freestyler, so more of a sorci
But he's a lil' gremlin
Viszonylag k�s�n megtanult �lni, �s n�ha direkt le�l �s felemeli a l�b�t mert azt hiszi ki tudja kuncsorogni a kaj�t XD
He also hates water
Es�t, f�rdeni, leslagozva lenni
Also likes to growl at me and act like he's gonna murder me for trying to play-take away his squeaky toys
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
You can now buy your burrito on a payment plan, you can finance on eating out (in America)

Most majdnem mondtam hogy a Daisy mit keres n�lad xD
Parents have a same breed dog at home
Looks almost exactly the same
Nice
Very old pictures from 2015 and 2016
� kever�k, de ja, a k�l�nbs�g csak annyi, hogy hosszabb l�bai vannak, mint a legt�bb sima Jack Russelnek
Yeah �gy m�r �n is l�tom hogy a ti�tek kever�k
Jack �s fox kever�k, yes?
�n meg nem mondtam volna ezekb�l tbh xDD
�n is csak annyib�l hogy Anna �rta a Jack Russelt, de �gy n�z ki mint egy sima sz�r� Fox Terrier (the doggo i sent in, she's Daisy)
XDDDD
Nem tudjuk
K�t �vesen hoztuk el a menhelyr�l. Dog XD
XDDD well �gy n�z ki mint egy smooth hair fox terrier
Sooooo
:D
But ye who knows
Asszem valami Parson Russel kever�ket mondtak neki
*He always looks like he is beholding something unexplainable. Beholding the colors unlike any seen on Earth*
he cant read
*The number one 'pay attention to me, not this' move of cats*
He has an interesting stare for sure xDDD
Szerintem �n m�g nem l�ttam hogy ilyen f�gg�letes cs�kk� alakulna a pupill�ja
XD
Mindig csak az alien reflektorok
*I am still convinced he is at least 50% Grey* *No, not that one* XD
Here ezeken cs�k pupill�ja van xD
*It exists*
Nah, am�gy tuti l�ttam �gy, csak �ltal�ban az esetek nagy r�sz�ben googly szemei vannak
Yep
First pic
Server banner worthy tbh
He's reading a story for us
***HONESTLY***
XDDDDD

if Jesus is in you, that means Jesus is in *everybody*, which means it is a 6+ billion group sex thing.
unless we only count those who are at that very moment doing the dirty (which is still... probably a lot)

also consider... Jesus also includes the holy ghost and the father, so... yeah.
Its a constant 3 some on the basis

( for <@152824369805131776> bc he might not be at home with all the dnd dieties. <@886672003396927530> do you think she would recognise the title without a throw?)
(Just to make things more interesting :)) )
(isn't it lady of loss tho?)
(Fuck...did bg3 bamboozled me again?)
(Don't... rely on bg3 about information xD)
(Many things are incorrect/changed in the game)
(Im not...i just remember)
(tis alright, just made sure he isn't referring to another deity)
(u know, �gy tesz mintha m�st k�vetne)
(Nah i fixed it)
( *i want this to happen* )
(oh also just saying. Wotc made bg3 canon. Do with that info what you will.)
About that

(idk, do I know tha bich?)
(Fucking christ)
DANI NEM
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>

Austinon k�v�l csak Zinzana tudja ki az a lady of Sorrows
DAMN XDDDD
I was like DC10 should be good enough for Shar. It's a big cult but not like every day occurance big.
But she currently doesn't give a flying fuck
:3
And nobody knows who she is. Damn she must be fuming
Awww Zinnie might also just start to pity the rabid dog :D shar's the one who takes memories, ye? XD
Yes
*"Poor male, probably his god took his memories. Sucks to be him I suppose."*
Male xddd
XD
- Expecting respect is pointless from a particular group of people.. *Says looking towards Zin, then slowly turns her head back to the rogue*
- sometimes, you have to beat it into them.
*After the headache went through the elf, she just raises any eyebrow and points him a question*
- Lady of Loss.. The Mistress of yours?
(WHY ARE PEOPLE THREATHENING HIM XD)
(Okay he came with Sarevok...fair)
Reagot �rsz, nigka?
(yes, and he was really appreciative of him as well)
*Austin raises an eyebrow with a tired expression.* -Its just a sayin?
� Interesting, this dog was able to show respect in the past.
*She points to Rabid Dog not even looking at him while still studying her spellbook.*
� I assume his dear Lady of Loss took his memories. I almost pity his arse. **Almost**.
*Without a care in the world, she flips a page, continuing reading.*
-r 1d20+11
Oh also. I wanted to ask the party if you guys are alright with your character dying from time to time with the money and other helpful things at your disposal?
Yeee
:'D
Sure. Critical role always die on high level
Tho, one thing i don't like is how our characters on high level always seem to be able to come back. Death is just an inconveniece
So yeah. I wanna see the high level, stronk heroes die
<a:hellmage_emilyyeh:833496986657357824>
I dont, not permanently at least
But you guys have stuff to return as well
I know i know
The damned are in a dangerous situation tho
But like... you know what i mean
Yes I do. Comicbook heroes always come back after dying in epic battles. So shall you
Does that mean we get to reshape them in our way? :)
No it means you have to protect their bodies when they die
Ah
Otherwise they can die permanently.
Cuz Rash and Zinzana can be brought back after they get disintegrated or their bodies are dropped into lava, melting them away
For the damned that is a permanent death, with noreturn
Ouch
But like... the feeling, the situation, when you witness your teammate die, of whom you thought they're invincible, die in front of you while you are unable to do anything about it. You would, but you know it's useless, it's hopeless. Your teammate was holding the only thing they loved the most, their little trinket from their family as they cool and lose color on the ground, and that's when you realize; you are on unknown, dangerous waters where not even death can be dodged. And oh Hells, the unknown is terrifying.
You're scared.
*Austin blankly stares at the two justice warriors and stands up with no words said. He inquisitvely darts between them until he just sighs and shrugs with a blink.* - This should be fun. *He mumbles with a small grin and sits down.*
-# I love writing
-----------------------
This is actually fucking insane. Are these really the best they could find? We are not going to past Avernus if they pull a stunt like that with that dumbass Kelemvorite... Unprofessional and smug, theathrical push-overs. They cant be serious? They are going to break in no time.

Those two nobles. Delusional and stuck-up, up their ambitions are commendable.
And then in game it's just sad and underwhelming most times xD
We die to the stupidest things
You tell me? Look at all the trex deaths i have xDDDDD
Yupp
Trex is cool at least xD
But also dying to a boss is kinda badass in most scenarios
Usually, yes
Not after multiple times :'DDD
*His feet clack on the ground as he steadies himself as he lets out a short and painful mechanical wheeze from the jolt. He then shakes himself as a shiver runs down his spine. He blinks a few before he readjusts fully.*
- Well it doesn't sound fun. And neither does it feel like it. *He grunts.*
Usually don't even have time for a final scene or even final words
Honestly i'd love to have a rule of "when the character mechanically dies in combat, it's not dead yet, but is doomed to die a few minutes after combat, so said character can have final moments with the party after the encounter ended"
As a noncombatant? Sure. I'd allow that
Yes
But sometimes the death is just brutal with no chance at communication
<:point:951578243415302235>
Yeah ofc it's situation depended
Being ripped in half by a zonbie trex doesn't seem like an opportunity to have a final conversation
D:
Disintegrate xD
https://tenor.com/view/seongwa-hwa-seonghwa-ateez-hwa-ateez-ateez-gif-7980078480070192658
*Rash takes a look at the warforged, then gazes up towards the ceiling*
-There are a few advantages and good aspects of us going down, but the journey ahead will be rough.
*Then she takes a good look at all her future companions as continues*
- I'm not used to travel nor work together with unfamiliar faces for such lengths as we're about to. I pray it works out
https://youtu.be/5mclS2ZmUek?si=bNCmwkdNUA1irusQ
Ah yes, disintegrate my *beloved*
*Average D&D deaths* XD
I can fulfil anyone's wish of death by disintegrate :D
Meanwhile in Chthulhu: One person out of four survived, so that's a win
That character now has character development
The Doctor shall be back one day
Ah yeahm the damned will have to run against things that have it
Rem�lem addigra bele�ssa mag�t az okkultba �s � lesz Dr *Van Helsing* 2.0 XD

- If it means I can finally get some peace...
*He growls and shrugs.*
- Whatever to get my soul out of Hell, I've already lived that here.

------------------
This souless feeling is a state I am familiar with, yet its entirely something new. I am not sure if I have ever felt any different, but it is freeing nontheless. Lady Shar took one part of me and now the Hells ripped out the other. However convenient it might be, I still need to recover my soul in order to play by my own rules and secure my position in the grand scheme of things so I can play a little longer. The one thing I can do for certain is finding ways to obtain as much power as I can while doing the most damage to the Hells. 
I do not care if I die. I have been dead for a long time now. What matters is to decide whether I can show my cards to these morons or I should wait a little while more.
Eh
Idk xd
Btw
Akkor hol hogyan tali?
Szerintem ti m�r legyetek ott
�n meg majd leviszem
Alrighty
M�r lebesz�lt�k, hogy lej�n

Daddy will have a word with you
Asmodaddy
Daddy can go do his politics while i'm saving a life
Ah asmossuy
Azt hittem Zhoron
Zhoron is not your daddy here
OwO
*Funny, then why don't he come to greet them at his doorstep? Too busy being fused to his chair by the ass?*
*Rude*
Okay guys hear me out
That's Levistussy
Genderbent Hell level devil lords
I thought Asmodeus can't leave his level
Asmussy is perfectly capable of greeting the party. He just wishes not to.
Let me check something
I'm pretty sure most of them could do that as of now if they wanted to
Shapeshift and stuff like that
Okay but like, Dani would not survive that. Sexy devil ladies
There already are some
Found it. I'll PM you
XD
*I need to know the lore*
Among the lords?
Hehe
There are sexy devil ladies
There are 2 (supposed to be 3)
And one is regarded by many to be the beautiful being in the multiverse so...
Truly the beautiful being of the multiverse
Sonit's probably a milk-toast white woman XD
Dicegod decided to murder you xD
Kindaaaaaa
Show a picture
I wanna see how dead on the money I was with my guess
Okay, maybe not milk-toast
since she is a devil

I guess she is conventionally attractive
Kinda has to be if creatures across all planes agree about her looks
Then none of them are lords
Disappointing
Also she's the only being that can canonically call Amodeus daddy and be right xD
I wanna get stepped on by a devil lord lady
Wha?
She is
They are
Both are xD
Oh
OH
OH OKAY
I'm stupid
Who are they?
This is Glaysia. Lord of the 6th. Daughter of Asmodeus. Princess of Baator
Aaaahh i see
(it's the same character from different editions)
-# *Mommy*
*Zinzana dies*
The other is Fierna. Co-ruler of Phlegethos. She rules with her father.
I thought that was her bro
Nope

Yeah
Belial is the previous ruler of Phlegethos. Father of Fierna. Now he's an advisor but co-rules with her daughter
"Officically he's only an advisor"
*They be there, dressed like they about to hit the night clubs*

They are the night club
I'll make sure she steps on you.
With those bare feet
*Kuwe'i keres egy �jabb levelet, �s elkezd bel�le cs�nakot hajtogatni.*

lame
honestly
would be so funny if papa was the one who helped Kuweis mom to birth kuwei
(I like this one)
(this one feels like edge for edge's sake)
(L'edge pour L'edge)
you think he would've had some kindness like that already? :D
I mean
it was close to his break point
so I guess
(also nym doesn't look like a priest. He looks like a big metalic monster tho xD. If he's referring to him)
(I think he meant Rayana and Rash)
(I tought he mentioned Rayana as one of the nobles)
(Ah, yeah. Dunno why he thinks he's a priest)
(Is he a pala?)
(yes. But he has no religious affiliations)
could have been, or like he was tasked to help her since he was the cleric of the ship
viszont akkor az anyuka nem ismert volna fel t�ged?
(he recognised divine smite also i just referred him as such cuz....idk xd couldnt find a better word)
am�gy nem kell z�r�jelezni
az�rt van elv�lasztva a text
he is old now
and probs looked little different back then
also
come dc
(*The A-Men* XD)
ofc
yeah thats why i felt that a bit forced
or like
iffy
yeah, i tried to reflect his inner world a little more and how he plans a bit more seriously
but idk
<@520697326679883808> ?
Lol
Makes sense.
Azt am�gy Endre szerette volna. Mercy Monk, Vengeance Pala, some kind of Cleric (probably war or light) and a Zealot Barbarian
Doom music starts
Oh yeah also. <@875753704685436938> Succubi and Erinyes exist as well
So we do have sexy devil ladies just roaming around
But they are not lords hmph
But now you know that out of 9 archdukes 3 are ladies, 4 are men, 1 is a slug and one is an icicle
Not anymore but the OG ones
*Where's the attack chopper one?*
If a draw a very smexy devil duke will u use the art for one of them?
You can only pick one of the two but sure
Man
Fierna could go for upgrade
I meant a man
Oh wait
*Nine Hells Dating Sim*
But i guess i can draw a lady too
Let me check who I have good art for
Can we see glaysia from the book?
Okay so this means yes i can make art xD
You can. Just tell me which one you'd like
Sure gimme a sec

Ah
Ye no xd
Don't look at her whip. It's spoiler /jk
I like the one with her standing before the painting
I don't know i just make a very handsome somewhat bitchboyish devil duke and you tell me which one it fits xDDDDDD
Nika is already looking
That's the one I'm using for her. My favourite
Good
Very good
By that description. Could be any that isn't a chick, pitfiend, a slug, or an iceberg
<:point:951578243415302235>
So out of the 3 dude lords that don't have a good chosen art
Dispater and Mephisto could go for an upgrade
Well, yes
<a:hellmage_emilyyeh:833496986657357824>
Or Fierna cuz she's kinda basic
Oh wait fuck no nevermind
Fierna art in the book is good
She a spicy snack. Kinda coveres un soot but a snack
*That's not soot*
Oh no
https://tenor.com/view/mmm-tasty-hungry-burger-spiderman-gif-14473650
Anyway
Or I could use it as an original archdevil if you don't base it on any of them
I have a few in the book that have no illustrations or descriptions (other than an ugly 3d model xD)
As long as i will see it back in the game
-# And will punish me
I mean
Fight with us
I'm fine with whatever u use it for xD
Okay gimme a minute I'll look for something that will punish you
:D

If something else is granting you a wish, that's a different story, cuz it will use their idea of your wish

What meat? O.o
Tomorrow we arrive in Avernussy

Az is coolio, hogy a k�t csatorna egym�s mellett van xd
I'm going grilling
Just tireeeedd
I'd really rather just rest
It only takes a few minutes and you'll thank yourself tomorrow if you do it
I just finished making my breakfast burritos for the week so I get ya
Half an hour if I'm fast
What how?
Cube it, season and a bit of oil
I suck at measuring up how much of the oil+seasoning mix I'll need
So I'll have to remake it like 3 times
How much meat are you going to make and what seasonings do you have?
Seasoning is oil with this mixed up in it (these are ratios compared to each other)
1.2 salt
1 pepper
0.5 garlic
0.05 black pepper
And I have 500g csirke fil�
Pepper as in ground paprika right?
Yes
Alright
1 tablespoon oil
1 heaped teaspoon of paprika
1,5 teaspoon of salt
1 clove of garlic
A tiny pinch of black pepper (or just the tip of a coffee spoon)
Garlic is ground too

Annyi el�g mind az 500g h�sra? O.O
(a legt�bb esetben f�l kil� h�shoz m�sf�l te�skan�l s� el�g szokott lenni, a t�bbit az alapj�n be tudod m�r l�ni)
Kinda yeah. Half a kilo isn't a lot of meat.
Yeah
*No. Drown it in black pepper* XD
I would trust me, but I'm working with his parameters here xD
�n szerintem sim�n t�bbsz�r�s�t haszn�ltam eddig
�gy szoktam hogy bele m�rtogatom a mix-be �s �ltal�ban csak elfogy lol
*Would you trust you? I hope so. XD*
Ismer�s�m az a s� �s back pepper ar�nyt megszokta ford�tani xD
*Not an unreasonable thing*
�n ennyit tenn�k r�, azt�n �ztforgatn�m. There is a limit on how much it can absorb in one night so using more would be a waste of spices.
Kinti grillez�sre kb ilyen ar�nyvan szoktam keverni �n is. Annyi kiv�tellel, hogy megsz�rom csilivel is.
Ja meg probably csak laposra lesz v�gva + bev�g�sok mert csak cs�kos r�cs a grill lol
Oh. Yeah azt meg kell ujjaznod, hogy rendesen megkapja a p�cot

Egyszer evett n�lam, ez a kett� ugyanakkor volt v�ve �s csak a fent l�v� aranyokban haszn�lva
Ah that's a good fucking garlic spice
Man I should get one of those
I'll be genuinely impressed lol
You need to massage it into the meat
You refuse to believe me man
It hurts me man
T-T
Nuuh, I giving the benefit of a doubt, I'm doing it
I'll be just impressed cus this doesn't make sense in my eyes xd
This looks so
Barely seasoned ;-;
I'm used to it looking actual red xD
But I'll give taste report tomorrow
You are brining it so it should be good
But if I'm wrong I dunno. I'll get you something xD

Neither of these are dookie arts imo
Sure this doesn't have a bg but it's nicely rendered
Nemtudom. Nekem az els� nem j�n be annyira
Especially that this is one of the most important characters in the module
The second is way cooler i agree but the first isn't bad at all
It's just... more simple
Yea. I still couldn't draw anything close to that quality. I'm just not feeling it

Heya people! I am looking for more people to play and get invested in Turtle WoW! It is a free private server with A LOT of new content and more players than the actual sub based game.

There was an attempt xd
Or compromise
F�l 6 xD
But like... She made the decision to be your friend, now she should act like it cuz there are expectations in friendships.
/s
honestly I'm not really acting like a friend either but I was open about not really wanting to either, but I'm not an asshole to leave her completely alone if she needs to hang out with someone due to being completely isolated
but I'm highly pushing her to find other ppl
which to her credit, she is doing
she did hang out with someone on the weekend
big step
xD
Oh?

Nem, j� lesz a 6. Nem kell sietni senkinek

# Gauntlets of Rage
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard,
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

You gain the power of never-ending fury. After you
make a melee weapon attack, you automatically
enter a special fury for 1 minute. While furious, you
can�t cast spells, can�t verbally communicate, and
are immune to the charmed and frightened condi-
tions. Each time you deal damage, you regain 2d8
hit points and may immediately remove a condition
you currently suffer from or end this fury. Addition-
ally, while in this fury, you may spend a spell slot
before you make a melee attack. Doing so causes
the attack to deal an extra 3 (1d6) necrotic damage
per level of spell slot expended, if the attack hits.
Once used you may not use this fury again until you
finish a short or long rest.
It would be a shame if he dies

What is people's problem, I honestly don't get it
I didn't find a single change that would be actively a drawback, all of them are something I don't care about or actively insanely good
I was used to the old UI, and it's a big enough change to completely throw off my muscle memory.

left side where the icons are situated are more slick, and I often click on nothing or the edge of the app cause of the change in dimensions

the color change is honestly just ugly. it doesn't flow together anymore, and in it's place are agressive black lines to break up things into bigger blocks.

it's all washed out and lifeless, and none of the Appearence settings seems to have anything resembling the old look for non-nitro users to change into.
I'm sure I'll get used to it, just not sure why the change when the old look was fine, and this for sure isn't an upgrade in comparison...
https://tenor.com/view/captain-price-gif-11163798864566121593
I like it xD. He's fun
Muscle memory adapts, that's fine

The bottom left needed the more space cus it was damn cluttered, I thank whoever realised that 

Color change is something you choose when you got updated, the old one is still an option
Plus, jesus and the holy ghost have fursonas (a lamb and a white dove)
So it's furry, too.
Not sure about the father, does he have one, too?

it automatically was like that from one day to the next, if there is an option it wasn't intuitive, and should've been an opt-in alternative instead.


(btw this gauntlet is mwah. Such a cool magic item in my opinion)

(Yeees omg i love it)
(Tho, can one end the rage? It's a bit weirdly worded in the middle)
Nope
1 minute very very angy
Then calm for the rest of the day
Or until you take a rest xD
Also: You can take off magic items and still be attuned if you're not feeling like triggering it

Then what this? XD
:))))))
Oh wait yeah okay
You can end your angy it you hit someone
I missed that
Oh so it's not a half finished sentence, you either end a condition when dmging or end the fury. Got it
Or continue the fury. You don't have to pick from the two, they are just options
Yis
Okay
Nice
So you say the ruby and red stuff is just decor on the gloves?
Yes. She can take those off and it still feels like it has the same magic. Only the wraps and the leather have the burning runes on them
Aleight. Then Zinzana takes them off, and will pack it up and put it into the chest, with a note and signet sigil saying "Please be so kind and send this package to Zhoron Zassricrith"
And into the package, another note for her father "These were part of an item made for Granny, however it does not suit my appearance."
"Please send over my dancing ribbons and a pair of my old earrings. Thx dad."
"Thx love ya, take care"
XDD
"It's okay if you send it with the cloak in making"
XDDDD
And *then*, after the package is sent, she attunes
Putting a little box in the big box
Alright
Yes
She attunes on the longrest

GM just normal gameplay: "hey Ben, roll a will save"

Devil naming conventions are amazing
Bel, Bael, Baal and Baalzebul are all unique archdevils. And we can add in Bhaal for the fun of it.
Yeah
I was confused when you said Baalzebul and not Beelzebub
I don't get that either cuz Beelzebub is the lord of flies. Like Baalzebul. If they wanted him to be unique there was his old angel name Triel.
But instead we got "Beelzebub at home" xD
Yep
one of the players have a custom free action xDDDDD

*After Rash sits down to rest a little next to the dragon head on the floating disc, she glances at the trophy and fistbumps its teeth.*
- Nice try big guy, but you should have known that struggle was futile. 
*She then starts slowly healing hearself as well as she can, while she turns her attention to the others.*
- Well fought guys. That went faster then expected.
*Austin seems frustrated and rubs his head after the dragon intruded his mind so rudely with his magic and made his ears bleed. He is carrying the Abishai armors and the fallen adventurer's gear with him while, grumpily walking not so far away from the others.*
-This is fucking insane... *He mumbles to himself.*
(*Austin is dealing with the 5 stages of grief*)

- Not much I could've done to be honest.

- If only... *mutters then turns towards Austin.*
- Welcome to Hell!
*He smiles at the elf, then his expression drops into something more neutal.*
- Honestly, what did you expect?

<:doggo:821429788635168769>
I'll send it tomorrow after work. I need to put some cash on my balance first
*The bladesinger looks Nym up and doen before speaking.*
�Don't blame yourself for the dragon being far far away from your reach. Though I'm sure Rash appreciates your help as a launching pad.
*Zinzana shoots a polite smile to him, her amethyst tiara around her head pulsing in a slow, rythmic unison with the floating disc following her behind.*
� Moreover, just standing in your vicinity, you existing on the battlefield is a great boost by itself. You have an... interesting aura, for sure.
*She nods approvingly, laying her eyes on Rash too.*
� It was quite impressing what you've done back there. I wonder if you could've done it without breaking a bone in the end?

(This man has been auramaxing his whole life)
*The elf squints and shakes his head incredulously at the robo-elf's question.* -Thats not what I meant...
*He takes a quick breath and gathers himself to hasten his pace to get ahead of the team. His steps are more confident and firm, serious as his demeanor.  * -What I meant is that this is not something I am used to as a strategic technique in order to prevail over my enemies. *Getting past Zinzana he shoots her a mean glare and continues walking at the front of the party.*
- I'll have to work a bit more on the landing, i'll get it right next time
*Replies with a grin to Zinzana*
- I don't usually ride dragons, but it does seem like a working method.
*As the fuming elf passes her, she hold her tongue, then replies after*
- You started it well "Mister leave me alone", and we finished it nice and clean, leaving it just enough time to process what fate awaited him for crossing Helm's will.
*With a proud smile she leans her back at the dragon. *
-r morning
*He others cant see but the cringing of his shoulders suspects the rapid twitching of his eyes as well. He holds himself even higher and looks back.* -I do not need approval to know I'm "starting it well" or to be sure that I am doing the right thing. I am not known to be so reckless as some... *His high nosey elvish behavior is prominent as he is clearly bothered by the results of their recent encounter and the execution of their "plan".*

<@520697326679883808> i guess here
(did Andrew Tate take your phone or what?)
*One stormy and gloomy night on the ship to their next adventure, the changeling sits outside of their cabin with the company of a oil lamp and a glass of red wine to ease his mind from the warring sea with the thunderous fury of the skies. With troubled eyes he looks outside of the window at the vast waves of the upset Ocean. -May the Bitchqueen spare us. He whispers to himself and drinks up the wine from his glass to ready himself another from the flagon next to him, which he has to grab not to let it slide away as the ship sways. Yet it slips our of his fingers and rolls all the way down the floor only to stop at their cabin's door with a thud. He flinches, hoping he didnt wake his traveling companion.*
(nah, i sorry im just taking too much of my character)
(Yippee)
im really sorry
kicsit t�ls�gosan bele�lem magam a karakteremb
lehet kicsit a h�tv�ge is sok volt most
i feel kinda unstable emotionally
*She just blinks not quite grasping his problem*
- I mean you stayed hidden.. ~for a while~ and did you smoosh-smoosh shady play, and then we finished the fight. It wasn't reckless, so I don't fully get what you're referring to.
(Reg� don't fall in love her cuz you're gonna be the Zorah to his Bastian)
*Austin looks concerned for a second then just sighs in disappointment.* -I was talking about you...*Helmite*...
*Some time after the thud, the cabin door opens and a 185 cm tall young man steps out. His sleepwear is made of fine materials and is decorated with a couple small embroideries. The aasimar has pale, marble-like skin, short, slicked back, ash brown colored hair from which a few delicate feathers grow and wither every few days. On his chin is a well groomed beard, and a thin mustache stretches from under his nose to the corners of his mouth. These share the same hue as his locks and feathers. He glances towards the changeling with his mostly black eyes, only their brownish irises give any life and warmth to them. Enwir smiles at his friend, closes the door behind himself, and walks up to the changeling, but the smoothness of his movements doesn't indicate that he just woke up. As he takes his place next to the other man, a scratching sound can be heard from the cabin door, followed by clicking. He sighs a bit but is more focused on the fellow beside him.*
- How come you are as gloomy as the weather, *Moonlight*? *His question is genuine but he tries lighting the mood with a nickname that reminds him of the changeling's true form.*
(Just for heads up for past reference: Enwir szinte mindig elvonul �jszak�ra a csapatt�l, mindenkit�l, egyed�l alszik t�volabb a s�tr�ban/kabinban/szob�j�ban, kiv�ve amikor fent marad besz�lgetni m�sokkal)
(Usually this goes the same after spending some quality time together too. He goes back to his place)
(Austin el�bb �ln� meg mag�t, de lehet�leg Rash-t, miel�tt beleszeretne XD)

It's not viable tho in 24 if I remember right. I think it says you can't use magic action from action surge

xD
1 _ 1
Oh, no wait. I get it now. *It's a fighter that can count and actually do their math homework*
(*Sees typing. Neuron activation*)
*As the aasimar emerges from the cabin he finds himself face to face with the concerned eyes of his changling partner who is just sitting up after watching the flagon hit the door. He looks somewhat relieved, seeing the other not being upset over being drawn out from his cabin. He looks him in the eye but quickly averts his gaze from him with a worried look on his face, clasping the wineglass like a tool of survival that secures him against the storm.* -Its just...Difficult night is all... *He scoffs stressfully with a small smirk, attempting to cover his discomfort, but clearly failing to do so.* -I dont like storm this violent...They remind me of a dark day from the past... *He sighs and as in order to keep himself calm, as Enwir could notice how the changeling usually does, he turns into his other form. His shoulders broaden and his eyes roll into a slitted ball of a feline, whipping a tail being his back and growing out tabby fur in the process. Tufted ears sprout from his head as he completes his transformation into his tabaxi form, Whiskers. Enwir can be quite familiar with him as Illigen usually turn into him when he feels specially upset to cheer himself up or to look more confidant.*
*He quietly starts purring to himself in order to loosen up a little.* -How scared shall we be? *Whiskers asks in a more rattly voice than Illigen has.*
this is still so fucking gold
xDDDDDD
- That makes the two of us. *He answers to Illigen's first sentence, but the yawn he suppressed with the help of his palm, and the nigh every day present bags under his eyes, that deepen by the lamp light tell the tale before he even parts his lips. As he's sitting beside the now tabaxi, he reaches for something in his underwear's only pocket. He mutters a few words in a quiet voice, and through the fabric a greenish glow begins to emanate. The flagon is lifted from the floorboards by something that cannot be seen by the naked eye, and is carried back to the table, being gently placed down in front of the two. It seems like he forgot to pick it up when he was standing right next to it, or he wouldn't be caught dead cleaning up after others himself, like a maid. As the "catman" voices his unease, he reaches out with his left to run his fingers through the fur on the feline's shoulder. If it wasn't Illigen, whom he's known for years now and is the only long lasting friend he made along his journeys, he probably would keep distance through being playful, mannerly or snide when it comes to feelings. A short hum resonates from his throat.*
- I am no protector anymore, but I can lend you my company and ear to help alleviate your fear, my paramour. 
*He doesn't stop with the stroking.*

� Deal with it. You can not control everything in the world. If Rash wishes to fight like that, then she shall fight like that.
<@&1307302474109161505>  Could we hold back on the Austin slander a bit? It's getting to a level where it's ruining someone's fun, so please. The rabid dog comment would also be retconned, because it is having an incredibly averse effect, something Reg� didn't expect when he said that line. Thank you for your understanding.
Alrighty and sorry about it :c
I think the rabid dog comment at the start was a great character moment tbh
But ye
No problem. Nobody did anything expressively bad, it just went overboard a bit.
De...tudtam volna sz�lni �n is xd
But thank you
It was, I just didnt know it would end like this. A gondom az legink�bb, hogy azt se tudom milyen legyen igaz�n a karakter mert annyira j� akarom megcsin�lni, hogy t�kr�zze az eredti elk�pzel�st, hogy m�r belezavarodok
�s maga a karakter soha nem volt csapatban, de szerettem volna a lehet� legokosabban �s megf�leml�t�bben j�tszani, hogy olyan legyen ahogy elk�pzeltem :(( but it earned the opposite. People just despise him which is valid
It fits
I just hoped to me more...idk feared or regarded with more respect
But i also know that this is not the same character as it was in the past lore-wise
He is in a completely detached situation from his original concept
But i just wanted to play him as intended
And now its just a mess
Bc nobody is like "omg this THAT Austin? Okay he is better not be messed with." Or something
Tudom, hogy mindenkinek tetszik, which is great im just living for this current setup cuz me, personally cant keep up this bickering forever. At some point im out of ideas and it just makes me frustrated which just leads to more misplays
I was thinking about just being more humble and apologetic but that just really not his character
And I also think he sees a lot things that the party doesnt and being constantly "shot down" in character while trying to play and plot out of game is just doesnt feel rewards.
We didn't really get a legend u know
De honestly m�r t�nyleg nem tudom hogyan csin�ljam, legink�bb ez a bajom XD
That may have been good for these supposedly earth shattering characters
Yeah, ez nekem is lej�tt, azt hittem Dani jobban be fogja mutatni
Just each of us write a general legend that anyone could've heard
Sz�lhattam volna r�la, de gondoltam hogy j� �gy is cuz
Not EVERYONE might know him
Fair
Yeah
Meg nem is azt mondom, hogy most mindenki ugr�lja k�rbe, mert tetszik ez a csapatfel�ll�s
Csak t�nyleg, �sszem�rve a csapat er�viszonyokat...he is the weakest cuz rogues are just...not that strong but to me thats the most fitting for him. Ami csak az�rt szar mert player settingben meg �gy semmi k�ppen sem lesz az a basz� karakter�tlet amit kital�ltam.
Basically b�rki le tudn� 1v1-ezni i feel like xd
Dani is mondta, hogy erinnel is ez volt a baj
Szerintem Nym nem tudn� megverni tbh xDD
And that also just results me having to be more reversed bc anyone could jusr slap the fuck out of him ...
T�vols�gban es�lytelen hogy utol�rjen
He has a bad wis, if he gets locked he is fucked
Lol
H�rom l�v�s �s halok xD
Visszafogom �n is a rabid dog megjegyz�deket. Eddig ha RPben * csillagok k�z�tt jelent meg a Rabid Dog * az els� sorban az�rt volt mert ingame Austin �gy mutatkozott be �s canon a karakterek nem is tudj�k a nev�t
De azt�n lett mondva Belzebussy is mondta a nev�t meg azt�n zinnie is
Csak az a baj, hogy nem tudom hogyan k�zel�tsem meg a dolgot an�lk�l, hogx azt �rezzem, hogx meg kell huny�szkodnia
And his sin is pride goddam it
Meg azt �rzem hogy a csapatos ellenszenv miatt kev�sbe van �rv�nyes�tve amit csin�l vagy mond
Fair enough
Nem volt t�rer�m
Erre �rtam
De lehet csak alab�l Zinzana olyan hogy mindenk�pp meg a saj�t feje ut�n
Zinnie just demands respect, m�shogy is meg lehet oldani mint meghuny�szkodnia
He could start with a proper, face to face self introduction
I honestly had an idea for that
Its just still end up like
Ehh
Semmi lekezel� nincs abban ha bemutatkozik in my humble opinion
Idk it feels like its already just fucked up
I mean
I think you could be prideful
No issue with that
I honestly don't see the team attacking him for that
No but he still wont be taken seriously
I just wanted him to be a bit more intimidating
And now his outbursts would just look like just childish tantrums
Maybe, but do you take someone excessively prideful seriously?
Idk
Maybe he just explodes and then everyone can move on xd
Ez utan �gy is k�rbe lesz�nk v�ve t�bb ezres handseggel
Aaand thats why i didnt become an actor xdd
Itd be fucking scizophrenic by now xd
(Does she say this matter-of-factly?)
(I think so, nincs semmi g�ny a hangj�ban)
(Ah, okay)
*Austin looks up at the sky infront of him and stays silent for a bit, feeling like the same empty vessle he was in the temple of Kelemvor.* -No shit... *He proceeds to walk not looking or turning to anyone for a good while.*
Na
Sry munka
I don't think it'd be childish
That's what I wanted xd
Playing evil prideful is difficult, don't stress it much
I just dont know how to approach it and direct it to the game
I should just wait but i really wanna play more
I just know id just turn the character inside out
They evolve when played
Nym was different too
But I let him evolve
Maybe if we survive and get back on the ship
XDD
<@&1307302474109161505> M�rknak j� a kedd. Do we want to go ahead with 1 missing (and joining later on) or should we wait for the whole team?
Rash most kicsit k�nnyebben kimagyar�zhat� a harcb�l a l�ba miatt �gyis.
Sure lets do it
Nem lesz hossz� napom holnap
Sounds good to me
He won't be entirely missing so ye :3

I mean, 7t�l van a teszt
Ha nem akarja r�gt�n el�tte �tn�zni akkor j�het xD
Meglehet hogy az eleje fele is leszek, b�r ez az anyag mennyis�gt�l f�gg. We shall see

*Broken legged fragile titling, hmm danger i smell, danger* xD
Master tactician. Martials are strong but only as strong as their supports
If you get rid of the chain links keeping the team together the rest is easy peasy
(I could hear Zinzana and Nym take a deep breath)
- A little rash perhaps, I get that a lot, nothing new in it. I just like getting the things done fast so I can have time for a cup of tea.
*She nods to herself approvingly*
- Yes, I shall make one when we get back to our little ship.
*She thinks for a second*
- I dont remember exactly what kind I packed up. I was in a bit of a hurry back then.
*My hands feel weak* **;-;**

*Nem olyan messze a t�bbiekt�l, a romokhoz k�zelebb kicsit, Papa megk�ri Kuweit, hogy �lj�n le.* -Szeretn�k besz�lgetni veled, ha nem b�nod. �gy hiszem j�t tenne mindkett�nknek. *Komoran markolja nyakl�nc�t ahogy r�veti fekete szemeit Fyrkil's Fall megrontott romjaira.*
And she's a woman as well
Making it even worse
*Time to time a few quiet red lightning bolts run through the sky above the far away ruins.*
*Kuwe'i a v�r�s vill�mokat b�mulva lehuppan a f�ldre, nagy terpeszben, felh�zott t�rdeire t�masztva k�ny�keit. Arc�n a vill�mok l�tt�n eluralkodik a d�h �s az undor, ahogy a kal�zkapit�ny �l� hull�j�nak mozg� alakja j�tsz�dik lelki szemei el�tt.*
*T�relmesen v�r Pap�ra hogy belekezdjen mondand�j�ba.*
Sits on top of a bunch of dead devils slurping her tea during short rests xD
*Sajn�lattal n�zi a monumentet �s azt�n azt ahogy a fiatal manakiban ilyen er�s, felkavar� �rz�seket kelt a hely �s az, amiket az elm�lt napokban tapasztaltak. Kicsit k�zelebb tipeg hozz�, hogy elvonja a figyelm�t a vill�mokr�l.* -Szeretn�k bocs�natot k�rni, ami�rt olyan szigor�an r�d sz�ltam p�r napja. Mindenkit nagyon felkavar a jelenlegi helyzet �s nem felt�tlen�l...kezeltem �gy a helyzetet, ahogy kellett volna. *Nehezen s�hajt egyet, pr�v�lva enyh�teni mag�ban a helyzet s�ly�t.* -�n magam sem tudom pontosan, hogy mit k�ne tenni...De tal�n kezdhetem azzal, hogy megbizonyosodok arr�l, hogy ti j�l vagytok. *Papa lehajol, hogy ujjaival maga fel� ford�tsa Kuwei fej�t az �ll�n�l fogva.* -Legel�sz�r veled kezdve...
Ezt csak az�rt is �rtam, hogy legyen valami amivel meglehessen esetleg zsarolni
That might also help him turn a little
I know about his sisters don't worry
Depend on how you'll go trough the campaign

*He notices that his touch is currently unwanted, and lifts it from him.*
- It was you and someone else who he was occasionally hinting at? He never elaborated on it. I can see now why. *He leans back a bit to give space to the distressed soul.*
- And could you tell me more, Whiskers? I want to help, but I cannot if I do not know anything. 
*Meanwhile something slightly opens the cabin door. For a few seconds nothing seems to emerge, until the clicking starts, and a long and slim shadowy figure crawls across the wooden floor. Enwir tenses as his pet reaches them, and climbs up his leg, his torso, under his clothes, until it settles around his neck. He stares at it with a glare and the giant centipede curls up into a ball, then morphs into a brown rat. After this, it balances on one of his shoulders, probably the one a bit farther away from Whiskers. E does not let this take away his attention from his damaged companion.*

Oh yeah also. Since she attuned Zinzana feels a constant sense of tenseness and frustration.

*Pepsi gets sued when a customer founds a whole mouse in a pepsi can*

Pepsi:
a) quietly settle the matter outside of court
b) highlight expert safety standards
c) utilize experts to scientifically prove that a mouse could not have been found in the soda, as the acidic concoction would have dissolved the body into a (quote) "jelly-like substance" in a matter of 30 days.
M�g nem tudni anyu�k mennek-e nyaralni, de i guess ha mennek nem megyek vel�k xD
xD
```
By 30 days of exposure to the fluid, all of the mouse's structure will disintegrate to the point where the structures (excepting possibly a portion of the tail) will not be recognizable and, there fore, the animal itself will not be recognizable. Instead, after 30 days in the fluid the mouse will have been transformed into a 'jelly-like' substance.
```

But i could just... choochoo the way to you? To finland? From here?
There are train rides from here?
Well i guess �tsz�ll�ssal, sure
I mean
depends how long you want it to be XD
if you only want the 14 hour single ride you just fly to helsinki and take the train to Rovaniemi (yes it is a 14 hour single train ride straight across the country
you can also take a few trains to Tallinn (in estonia) take a ferry to Helsinki and then do that trainride xD

*Nym steps to the dragon's severed head as well and places a hand on its snout.*

*He says with a slight chuckle but there's a clear disdain in his voice.*
- But not this kind. Mostly red and white instead. Vile beasts truly, they really do belong to this hellish place.

--------------------------
*During the different events where Austin is constantly being thrashed, thrown around and killed on repeat whatever he does, he is waved at by a beautiful elven lady who looks kind of similar to his sisters in some ways, but still unique in her own way.*
\- Heeeey! Youuu! Do you have a minute?!
*Before Austin could react he dies again during a Lancing tournament that he didn't even get a horse for this time. He wakes up sitting bellow the lady who called him.*
*He looks up with a dizty head and throws away his lance in frustration before carefully getting up to look at the beautiful elven lady. Despire his fatigued mind, he tries his best to focus on her.*
-What? Who the fuck are you? Cant you let me struggle in peace for eternity??
(An arrow gets him in the neck xddd)
*She smiles and lets out a wicked laugh*
\- If you want, I can leave to let you struggle further. Or I can be a short yet meaningful moment of peace. *Austin notices that the other competitors are avoiding him right now. The tournament looks closer to what one should be like. One he could even watch in some cities at home.*
*He looks pissed as he snarls at the other contestants than looks the lady in the eyes in sheer anger.* -Whatever divine intervention or made up wickedness you are from my twister mind, nake it brief. I am noones responsability from now on..
\- You think they won't call you back? You still have your uses to them, this won't last. But anyhow Austin I wanted to ask something... *The elf's head turns to the lady as if forced to look in her eyes, that have an infernal glow.*
\- Do you take pride in your work?
*He looks puzzled for a second and by the forced eye contact he feels even uncomfortable and angrier.* -What work of mine you are referring to?
-I have done plenty in the past centuries...
\- The one you could never put down and never escape from. The one that makes the recipiant... Bleed.
*His whole body tenses up, as much as it can in this current state of being and his face morphs into a furious expression.* -I only kill for necessity, I am not that foolish and young anymore to snuff out ones life out of pure pettiness or fancy...unless they really deserve it and cross the lines.
*She laughs again*
\- No no no silly. I know why you do it. *She rolls her eyes.*
\- Of course I do. We all do. But do you take pride in your methods? The cleanliness of them? Or the messiness if that's your style, I don't judge.
-Of course I do... *He spits in disbelief offended by the question.* -This is the end chapter of my life's work...Who wouldn't if they had sacrificed everything in order to keep universal balance??!
\- Now that's better to hear than any mortal scream! *Austin is forced to turn back towards the games as the conversation continues.*
\- You'll be my favourite I'm sure. *She coughs to get herself back on track, almost as if she's too excited*
\- So... Do you wanna show your pride to the world? Do you want it to elevate you to that next level? To see what you'll be able to achieve during these last few years of your miserable, mortal life?
*He grits his teeth and tries to move, regaining control over his body.* -I am not miserable! You are greatly mistaken if you think I would cave in the moment of misery and failure! You do not know me!
\- Hah. So hung up on the smaller details. Just like all of them, you mortals are so alike... Ultimately you're the cause of your own downfall. But who says there's nothing beautiful in the down? Tell me Austin Liadon, what would you do if you'd have an eternity to plot, an eternety to plan, and an eternety to kill those that dissagree with you? Would you sit in your pitty... Or would you try to do the most of it?
-I just wish to be out of range and touch of those like you and the puny common mortals souls that understand nothing of the World, even less then I do! Who are you??
*She makes a sushing sound*
\- I'm just a kind hearthed lady in your dreams, what else would I be? Haha no. I'm someone who can grant you freedom. Freedom to say and do whatever you wish, freedom from those who'd judge you. Complete freedom. I have nothing to lose here you know. I'm as safe as one could be. Safer than those pesky gods... And so could you. 
*Austin can hear the lady stand up and stretch, the rustling of clothes indicate she might have taken her coat up and is ready to leave.*
\- I remind you that I'm here out of no obligation, only my good heart took me to you. If you don't want help that is offered at no price be a fool. I don't mind, I can wait for someone who outdoes your pride... Skills... Knowledge... History. Last chance.
(miss fairy godmotrher)
-You should know that I have expertise in deception and lies, I know when someone is using it against me! (that is a lie tho he has a +4 insight and thats it xd) So my apologies if I am somewhat wary of your identity and intentions. If you truly reached out to me out of pure generosity and kindness, please make sure to convince me better so I can consider my options more carefully.
(let me check something)
(alright)
(ye she lies with a +25 so good luck bro)
(yeah lol)
(even if he believed her he is very paranoid...gondolom �rthet� mi�rt.)
-Or just say a name...
*Austin can hear her shoes clicking as she steps to the door. No reaction, no words, no anything.*
(SAY A NAME BICH)
.
(Out of game as well. Last chance.)
(fuck im too paranoid too since oota xd)
(this is not oota xD. And I won't try to convince you forever. These things have places to be, things to do.)
(j� de fogalmam sincs mi ez. Austin sem tudn�? vagy lenne sejt�se?)
(csak nem akarom egy orinvia meg giaz szitut megint)
(This is all you have to go off of. Also remember that they can't lie. As in they are physically incapable of doing so. If she says no price, out of the kindness of her heart, it is so. Maybe with a twist, but you'll never know)
(yeah csak t�nyleg nem akarok megint shunnolva lenni vagy elbaszni valamit �s csak szenvedni miatta eg�sz kamp�ny alatt)
(no therius or tiip 2.0)
(How would freedom make you be shunned? XD)
(it's not like that dw. I don't even think the campaign has anything that would be anywhere near Kevin fuckery)
(okay)
(in that case)
-Alright! *He yells.* -One last time...I either die down here anyways or I can get everything I want...If you really the gateway to that...*sigh* Let it be...I have already served a Lady of Great Influance once....But after that...I want to be left alone...
*She scoffs*
\- Too interested huh? Alright... Let your pride lead your way Austin. Follow it to the deepest pits of hellfire if you must.
*He can hear a door creaking on the podium above him.*
\- Oh and one final thing! Do you know how I take pride in my kills? hm?
-How? *He asks in bemusement.*
*An arrow pierces Austin's throat.*
\- I make others do it.
*The nightmare starts again.*
(de wait akkor most what?)
(beleegyezett, hogy elfogadja a seg�ts�g�t)

Yes.
soooooooo?
im confused
# Taking Pride in your Work:
Nothing is more important than your good name. 
- Every time the character kills or hurts a non-evil creature that didn�t start hostilities, they gain a Pride Point. 
- If the character finishes a long rest without having spent a single Pride Point since their last long rest, they lose all remaining Pride Points. 
- They can spend a Pride Point to gain advantage on a single Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check.
:OOOOOOOO
csak erre tudok akkor PP-t k�lteni?
igen
ezt �gy fogjuk h�vni
anonimit�s kedv��rt

*Whiskers seems very retracted despite being a protector persona but considers Enwir's offer of bonding. He sighs and taps the barrel they use as a table with his clawed fingers, leaning in after to recline on the barrel.* -It was a day of unfortunate events...on a night like such as this. *He looks at Enwir (I almost casually wrote Viren) with a new sparkle of determination in his eyes to tell this tragic tale of their past.* -We were very great friends for a while since they brought him to the orphanage...

*Papa toppant egyet nem tetsz�en a botj�val �s felsz�lal miel�tt helyet foglal Kuwei mellett.* -De igen is kell, mert akaratlanul is megterhelsz vele minket, nem �rted?! *Tal�n most m�sodj�ra emelte fel igaz�n a hangj�t �s hallatszott d�h�snek papa az elm�lt id�ben, ami�ta ismerik egym�st.* -A fene bel�d te gyerek. *Mondja inger�lten �s le�l Kuwei mell� a fej�t r�zva. Neh�zkesen lehuppan mell� �s megragadja a manaki v�ll�t, ami mellette van.* -Akkor j�l figyelj, mert t�nyleg �gy t�nik, hogy nehezen �rted meg azt, amit k�rnek t�led...Eml�kszel, amikor azt mondtam, hogy nyissd ki a szemed? Szeretn�m ha tudn�d, hogy m�r az elej�t�l fogva l�ttam benned, azt, amit te is magadban �s hiszek a t�rekv�sedben �s, hogy a helyes utat j�rod majd, de a tetteid �s a viselked�sed olyakor igen is el�g er�sen r�c�foltak arra, hogy azt a szem�lyt l�ssam benned, aki majd "felemelkedik"...Ak�r milyen er�t is birtokolj. *Hangja er�lyes �s figyelmet k�vetel�, tiszt�n l�tszik a lelkek �jabban r�tett hat�sa.* -�ppen ez�rt �s a sziget minden l�ny�nek �rdek�ben. *Itt er�sebben megszor�tja Kuwei v�ll�t �s kicsit megr�zza jobbra-balra.* -Nem hagyhatom, hogy ne felel�ss�gtudatosan �s a lelkekre val� figyelemmel cselekedj...Minden.

*A manaki frusztr�ltan a sz�j�hoz emeli az �sszefont f�sz�lakat �s az ajk�hoz kezdi nyomkodni. M�r majdnem r� is harap, de el�tte ink�bb fels�hajt �s �sszegy�ri a fonott z�ldet.*
� Jaj nem hiszem hogy a k�dob�l�s vagy a lev�lcs�nak hajtogat�s "tiszteletlens�g" lenne a szellemekkel szemben. Szerinted kommunik�ln�nak velem ha nem lenne k�lcs�s tisztelet k�ztem �s k�z�tt�k?

*Papa s�hajt.* -Lehet igazad van, �n csak t�nyleg seg�teni szeretn�k neked...�s k�rlek, ne hagyd, hogy a k�ts�geid ir�ny�tsanak...

� Hey, ne hagyj l�gva, ha m�r �gy felvezetted!
*Sz�l neki, egy kicsit tal�n s�rtve, de mintha visszaker�lt volna arc�ra a megszokott "Kuwe'i Malakai".*
btw yeah im curious about this
If you want to, we can have it this way
Hihi
*Papa meglepetten n�z Kuweire, mint aki teljesen elfelejtette, hogy mir�l van sz�, de azt�n mikor r�n�z a megint csak a romok balj�s szerkezet�re, felvonja a szem�ld�k�t.* -Csak, hogy igen is felel�ss�ggel tartozok �rted �s m�sok�rt is...F�leg a jelenlegi helyzetben, Kuwei, l�tom, hogy mennyire rossz hat�ssal van ez mindenkire �s...Nem szeretn�m tehetetlennek �rezni magam...�pp el�g id�t vesztegeltem a Vil�g�t� toronyban.
alright
*Pap�n l�tszik, hogy kicsit fesz�ltebb lesz ism�t, ahogy el�j�n az �l�holtak �s a r�gi id�k t�m�ja.*
*He doesn't want to interrupt the tale for now, instead he compares Illigen's childhood to his own. He was brought up in his parents' mansion in Waterdeep under the watchful eye of guards and servants, and the overprotectiveness of his mother and father. He was so precious to them as their only living child, their heir, that out of fear for his wellbeing, for the future of their house, they never let him venture beyond the gates of their estate. For years his only point of reference of the world, was his lectures about it, and stories he heard from his surroundings which, as it turned out years later, were often times very biased. He somewhat envies that Illigen at least had two great friends in his childhood, unlike him, although he already knows their story didn't end happily.*
(szerintem ugorhatunk)
(azt�n majd m�g max felhozzuk valamikor)
(akkor viszont)
*Koh Tam visszaj�n a szob�j�b�l egy p�r f�zettel �s odah�z egy dobozt Zinzana mell�*
\- Ezek majd seg�tenek valamennyit a rosszull�ttel. *Ezut�n vil�g�tani kezd az egyik tenyere*
\- Szabad?
(sec just making popcorn)
*Zinzana b�r karik�s szemekkel �s gyenge tart�ssal k�sz�lt volna neki�llni edzeni, Koh Tam �rkez�s�re kih�zza mag�t �s k�zelebb l�p a f�rfihoz. V�r�s szemeit v�gigp�szt�zza a f�zeteken, majd a vil�g�t� k�zre pillant.*
� K�sz�n�m.
*B�lint, majd hagyja hogy Koh Tam hozz� �rjen, fegyelmezetten tartva mag�t a resurrection sickness ellen�re is.*

Lahahana Lighthouse
*A l�*

Chapter 6: The Isles of Manaki 77 Stamps You can barely make out what Andrew is shouting over the ringing of the hammers and the roar of the forges, but you�re certain it isn�t complimentary. Thorsten seems unfazed. The Ikolf hermit sings to himself and the steel he�s working with, loudly and without a care in the world. As he moves around the forge in time with the tune in his head, you realize it�s more a dance than blacksmithing. Andrew stops his own work when you approach, and drops his hammer onto his anvil, raising his arms in defeat. �He�s insane! And he�s driv- ing me insane too with his incessant singing!

*As you stare out into the ocean emerging from the mist of the deep blue is a veritable ship graveyard, clearly the outcome of the battle years ago. In the center of the wreckage, you see a large ship with a split prow, and twin figureheads of horrifying sirens. The figureheads are oddly untouched by algae or barnacles, and the shimmering of the water makes it seem as though their gaze follows you as you swim around the wreckage.*

in my current game, my character has a title that is like given by the universe for her deeds
"Caladrel the Brave"
and we got to a section where everyone has to have a title so the others made up their own:
Tristan the Fragmented
Luna the Lesbian
*named for her deeds I see*
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
the guardians of the place also has titles, currently we are listening to the highly intellectual talks between
The Bold
and
The Lesbian
xD
*These would be neato Dark Souls boss titles* XD
the guardian titles are:
The Eager
The Bold
The Punished
The Regretful

This tree has the worst haircut I have ever seen
(EXCUSE ME??)
*Austin sok�ig �ll a haj� orr�n�l �s az agya sz�z fele j�r mik�zben n�zi, ahogy a Szt�x hull�mai sz�tv�lnak el�tt�k, pont �gy mint az � elm�je is az elm�lt t�rt�ntek ut�n. Els�re nem tudja hova tenni azt, hogy mi is k�sz�ti ki jobban, az, hogy ilyen inkompetensnek �s makacsnak v�lt csapattal �ldotta meg Shar vagy, hogy t�nyleg r�eszm�lt, arra  hogy hol is van �s, hogy pont ide lent halt meg. A hal�l, persze nem �j koncepci� sz�m�ra, sokkal ink�bb az, hogy ilyen k�nnyed�n �tlend�lt rajta �s, hogy k�vetkezm�nyei, sz�m�ra kevesebbet �rnek mint m�soknak...�s persze az is, hogy nem erre a hal�lra v�gyott igaz�n. �rn�je kegyetlen �s m�lyen megr�gz�lt tan�t�saib�l megtanulta, hogyan is lend�lj�n �t k�nnyed�n az ilyen v�gzetes eseteken. Eml�keiben felid�z�dnek azok az id�k mikor m�g � is ilyen fiatal volt �s zabol�zatlanul ment a falnak fejjel el�re. Ez viszont legink�bb haragot �s megvet�st sz�t fel benne, mik�zben az arc�nak �s lelketlen belsej�nek rendez�s�vel k�zd. Felfoghatatlannak tal�lja azt, hogy �jra ezt a helyzetet kell megtapasztalnia �s m�rhetetlen d�h j�rja �t, hogy �gy kij�tszotta saj�t mag�t �s b�szkes�ge �s imidzse k�r�ra ment az eg�sz...�s most itt van. Felzaklatva, v�gtelen gy�l�letet �rez maga ir�nt �s azok ir�nt, akik ide juttatt�k, legsz�vesebben felszak�tan� a b�rk�juk alj�t, hogy mind a Feled�sbe mer�ljenek �s v�gre megkaphassa a v�rva v�rt �r�k csendet. Azonban esz�be jut, a l�ny aj�nlata, ami hal�l�ban kereste fel... Szem�ld�ke �sszeh�z�dik �s tekintete kitisztul. Er�t mer�t abb�l, amit Shart�l tan�lt �s a felgy�lemlett gy�trelmeket arra haszn�lja, hogy ism�t tiszta fejjel gondolkodhasson. Nem fogja elfelejteni azt, ami eddig t�rt�nt vele �s balsorsra �t�lt csapat�val...Hogy mit gondol r�luk �s, hogy hogyan is �llnak hozz� mikor is nem megtapasztalt�k �nj�nek egy nyers r�sz�t, �s, hogy ez hova juttatta. Musz�ly lesz m�s taktik�hoz folyamodnia. 
Vesz egy m�ly l�legzetet �s elcsendes�ti az elm�j�t, hogy kidolgozza �j terv�t �s a vele j�r�, hazug...
*m�zolt �nj�t.*
*Az kell, hogy figyelmesen �s f�kusz�lta j�rjon el. Musz�ly megetetnie vel�k a szavakat, amiket a sz�juk k�v�n, enyh�n megfoh�szkodni, hogy jav�tson az es�lyein �s ne ker�lj�n m�g nagyobb vesz�lybe. Azt�n ha el�g id� eltelt �s a S�k m�r kihat�ssal lesz r�juk, amikor m�r maguk sem tudj�k ki az akiben b�zhatnak, akkor kell igaz�n cselekednie. Viszont ehhez az kell, hogy most fel�ll�tsa a sakkt�bl�t �s �gy viszinyuljon hozz�juk, ahogy �k szeretn�k. Austin b�szkes�ge hat�rtalan, de sz�mtalanszor j�tszotta m�r ezt a j�t�kot...Egy tan�csad�, egy keresked�, egy nemesi csal�d lesz�rmazottja, egy fatty�, egy apa, egy �rva...Mind haszn�lta m�r ahhoz, hogy el�r�bb jusson, �s most is, mikor m�r legkev�sb� van sz�j�ze a dologhoz, mikor m�r bele f�radt, hogy �lc�zza mag�t, mikor m�r a v�gy t�zk�nt �geti bel�lr�l, hogy v�gre �t ismerj�k �s csak egy szerepet, ami �pp megfelel a rendszernek, ami csak egy kell�k a nagy univerzum homokos v�dr�ben, hogy szemcs�nk�nt hordja az�rt, hogy bele illjen az �sszk�pbe, a szerep�be. 
Mindig is tudta, hogy Shar nelk�l ez soha nem ment volna neki csak �gy, m�g �gy is, hogy tudv�n milyen fogaskerekek is forgatj�k a vil�got. Hogy minden fogasker�k egy k�l�n dobozban van �s csak annyi kell, hogy beillessze mag�t a szerkezetbe. Ehhez azonban az istenn� seg�ts�ge kellett, hogy minduntalan csak �jabb �s �jabb eml�keket k�rjen mag�nak elfelejtve azt, hogy mi volt egy nappal ez el�tt. Tudta mi a feladata �s ez el�g volt sz�m�ra. Mind az kellett ahhoz, hogy most ezen a helyzeten t�leshessen �s elfoglalhassa hely�t st�blista nevei k�z�tt. Musz�ly kit�rni...Neki egyik doboz sem kell. � akar lenni az aki az alkatr�szeket karban tartja... �s senkinek nem lesz belesz�l�sa.*
*El�sz�r is fontos, hogy vissza t�rjen Zinzan�hoz, �gy mjnt mikor elm�letileg egykor tal�lkoztak. Lassan, de biztosan meg kell ismerni �t mintha eddig nem tudra volna, hogy ki �. Ez t�k�letes alap lesz ahhoz, hogy l�ssa a t�bbi, hogy lehet r� hallgatni. Ez ut�n ki kell tapogat�zni, hogy ki hogyan is �ll hozz� �s ahhoz, hogy itt lent vannak. Kinek mi a pontos c�lja �s, hogy meddig lenn�nek k�pesek elmenni, hogy v�ghez vigy�k azt. Ha megtal�lta a leggyeng�bb l�ncszemet azzal, el kell m�ly�teni a kapcsolatukat, hogy k�s�bb, ahogy egyre lejebb mennek �s mindenki elkezdi elvesz�teni az �nuralm�t, legyen valaki, aki megv�dheti, f�leg Rasht�l. Neki fog legnehezebben menni az elfogad�s. 
Austin nem tudv�n, hogy r� milyen hat�ssal lesz majd az �tv�ltoz�s v�gkimenetel, fogalma sincs milyen v�ltoztat�sok lesznek ebben a terveben, de tudja, hogy k�pes lesz adapt�l�dni, lesz�m�tva ha megint elveszti az �nuralm�t vagy az eml�keit vagy ha beke esik egy olyan egyezs�gbe, ami �tv�gja vagy m�sok miatt lekorl�tozza szabad akarat�ban.*
*Az �rd�g�k �r�k�s harca lesz a legfontosabb t�nyez�. �t kell gondolnia, hogy melyik�k fel� fog hajolni jobban �s, hogy melyikkel j�rja jobban a csapat ha �gy van, adni a szavukra f�leg ha az sz�m�ra is el�ny�s. Ehhez �t kell futni fej�ben, hogy miket is tud pontosan az Archdevilekr�l �s a kapcsolataikr�l. Musz�ly lesz a csapat haszn�ra v�ltania a tud�s�t egy szinten, m�g ha nem is l�tj�k m�g racion�lis n�zeteiben a logik�t.*
*Elkezd lassan a fed�lzeten, fel-al� j�rni mik�zben gondolkozik. *
*Tudnia kell uralkodnia a helyzeten, az embereken �s devileken. Ha kell megh�zza mag�t vagy csak mosolyog �s b�logat. Nem kell eladnia semmit, de tudnia kell mikor kell a ugrani a lehet�s�gre.*
*Rendben! M�g egy m�ly leveg� �s...Feln�z, arc�ra ki�l az ideges tekintent ugyan �gy mint a fel�lszt�se ut�n, b�r sokkal enyh�bb, hogy nyugotabbnak t�nj�n. Kim�rten, de er�s l�ptekkel megindul lefel� a t�bbiekhez.*
today we learned if you shout lesbian loud enough, you will land the perfect crit on the final attack against the boss
(what?)
Am�gy nem is ti vagytok a legrosszabb csapat. Van egy csapat akik harmadik sessionj�kre m�r 2szer cser�ltek karaktereket. Egyszer elmentek Tiamathoz kezd�snek, �s megfenyegett�k (guess how it ended) ut�na az �j karakterek a harmadik session-�n thaumaturgi�val megfenyegett�k Zarielt amikor a flying fortress �trep�lt a haj� f�l�tt (guess how it ended)

� K�sz�n�m.
*Biccent Zinzana miut�n Koh Tam begy�gy�totta sebeit.*
� Tiax meggy�gy�thatja saj�t v�g�sait, melyeket a gerinctelen k�r�rvend� megjegyz�sei ut�n t�rt�n� randev�n szerzett, ahol megismerkedett a legyez�m peng�ivel.
*Pukedlizik, azzal az eml�tett legyez�t k�zbe veszi, �s a training dummy-val kezd szemezni.*
� Miut�n elhaszn�l�dik az edz�b�bu, �jat k�sz�t�nk vagy Tiaxot �ll�tjuk a hely�re?
*He pasues, seeing Enwir contemplating on something and waits for him to focus back on him. His ears perk and leans back, slightly leave more space between them.* -Most children were scared of him. Noone really dared to stay close to. Some even really made a real bet out of him, seeing who would be brave enough to touch him.... *Despite this awful experience, Whiskers smirk, like he remembers these memories fondly, though it's not sure if it's really him or Illigen's conciousness sifts through.* -Not us though...I was already an outcast, being all furry and a real rascal, and Torielle was already too smug and sassy to just befriend anyone. *Whisker snickers which make his whiskers  vibrate on his fuzzy face.* -But perhaps she just needed someond like us...She really did care for us both...Like and older sister.
*Fel�lr�l, er�s, hat�rozott l�ptek r�zz�k meg a haj� als� r�sz�t, ahogy Austin leviharzik a t�bbiekhez. Sebesen kinyitja az ajt�t �s cuccaihoz siet, ahol felkapja a rapier-j�t �s alaposan megvizsg�lja, peng�vel felfele, hogy mennyire s�r�lt meg az ut�bbi harcban. Miut�n megbizonyosodott r�la, hogy nincs igaz�n baja �s �tt�rli egy ronggyal.*
*Arca sokkal nyugodtabb mint miut�n �jra �ledt, de ugyan olyan ny�zott �s megviselt, szemei m�g mindig haragos l�ngokkal �gnek, de j�val �sszeszedettebb mint mikor a Szt�xb�l akart inni. Nem vad �s zabol�zatlan, sokkal ink�bb koncentr�lt �s visszafogott, hogy csak mag�t �gesse. V�gign�z azokon, akik a szob�ban tart�zkodnak �s kardj�t h�vely�be csapja egy gyors mozdulattal. Ugyan az Austin mint ez el�tt, de m�gis valahogy m�sabb. Kisug�rz�sa sokkal kim�rtebb �s elsz�ntabb.* -Rem�lem mostm�r �rzitek, hogy ez mennyire nem lesz egy s�tagalopp...Nem f�lem a hal�lt, de nem �ll sz�nd�komban minden egyes szinten �sszekaparni a saj�t vagy m�sok test�t...El�ny�sebb lenne azt elker�lni... *R�mered Zinzan�ra rem�lve, hogy n�mi egyet�rt�st l�t majd szemeiben.* -E mellett �gy hiszem kicsit elhamarkodottak voltunk egym�ssal szemben. *V�gign�z mindenkin, akin tud, arc�r�l semmi f�le �rzelem a d�h�n k�v�l nem olvashat� le. V�r egy pillanatot, hogy hagyjon id�t m�soknak r�figyelni.* -A nevem Austin Liadon! *Jelenti ki nyomat�kos hangs�llyal.* -Szeretn�m ha mindenki a nevemen h�vna. Ak�r mit hallottatok vagy tudtok r�lam az mind �n vagyok....Azonban ugyan �gy c�lom itt t�l�lni, hogy vissza szerezzem a lelkem...Jelenlek az az egy �rt�kem sz�momra. *Itt komorabban mered egy pillanatra �s odas�t�l Zinzan�hoz. Len�z r�, de nem ugyan azzal a megvet�ssel vagy undorral, ahogy ez el�tt. Sokkal szer�nyebben �s egy�tt�rz�bben �m ugyan olyan semleges arcberendez�ssel.* -Ak�r mikor is besz�lt�nk, �n arra nem eml�kszek...Sajn�lom.... Nem v�rom, hogy elhidd, �n tudom a saj�t igazam... *A szavak mintha nehezebben estek volna le a nyelv�r�.*
-Biztos �n voltam, de nem hiszem, hogy fel tudn�m id�zni azt az eml�ket....Tal�n jobb is.
*Zinzana egy ideig kif�rk�szhetetlen arccal figyeli Austint, felm�ri v�r�s, karik�s szemeivel, majd mintha az el�gedetts�g szikr�ja csillanna meg benn�k, egy g�nytalan, visszafogott, udvarias mosollyal sz�l a moon elfnek.*
� Ha j�l tudom, nem csak engem, hanem t�ged is �ssze kellett "kaparni", Liadon �r. De persze, nem c�lja senkinek sem minden szinten meghalni.
*Megforgatja kez�ben a legyez�j�t ahogy folytatja.*
� Eg�szen pontosan 24 �ve �s 267 napja tal�lkoztunk egyik csal�di b�lunkon, melyet megl�togatt�l. Nem v�rom el hogy mindenkinek �gy v�gjon az elm�je, mint az eny�m, de az�rt �gy �rzem j�val kor�bban is megt�rt�nhetett volna ez a besz�lget�s, elker�lve a kor�bbi konfliktusunkat.
*Utal Austin bemutatkoz�s�ra �s a m�lt tiszt�z�s�ra a nemes l�ny.*
(The human guy looks at himself thinking... I wasn't even born at that point... Wtf)

Warning: Trump bragging about murdering civilians
- I learned that kids can be cruel only from word of mouth... 
*Some children did live in the family estate with their servant parents, but they always excused themselves through some important chore they needed to do, and politely refused his company whenever he approached to play with them. He could have ordered them to stay, but he did not want to force them against their free will, against etiquette. Looking back on it, it could have been about their parents not wanting to potentially get in trouble if something went wrong, because if anything were to happen to him around those children, his parents would have been livid. Maybe it wasn't because of his personality. This thought only takes him less than a second after Whiskers' last spoken words, and he seems very invested in the tale.*
- I would like to think that I would have been your friend as well. Even Torielle's, as much as she can get on my nerves.
*He shines a reserved smile, after which he tries to rub the tiredness from his lashes. The rat still sits comfortably on his shoulder.*
(Yeah)
(Too bad now)
(i mean he thinks they died so...)
(but who knows ;)) )
(You do what you want)
(yeah it would be logical)
( i mean it could happen)
*At the mention of Torielle, the tabaxi squints and hunch up while his face shifts into a displeased look. Slowly, Whiskers' body shifts and reduces into a tiny frame of a woman, while his ears retract, his head sprouting hazel cascade of hair and from his tabby fur, he changes his skin into a soft bronze sheet of elven skin. Suddenly, Torielle sits before Enwir with his deadpan stare that could cut bread if she tried enough.* -Well, I don't...
I don't think this is shitposting territory
- You know, after all this time you still have such a distaste for my being, and I still do not know why... Are you worried that I would get you three into trouble? 
*He sighs, but his voice does not shift into any other emotion, it stays dignified, and his posture is still relaxed.*
- Because you would be right about that... but that does not change the fact that the choice to leave anytime you want lies with you. And yet you stay in my presence instead of going. How curious.
*He smirks slightly.*
it is utter shit and this guy is just getting more and more unreasonable >.<
*gets to Oulu university*
"so this is the main corridor, about 2 kms long as it runs through the whole facility"
XD
Also they just have a workshop with all kinds of tools that is free to use for anyone
Some random sitting area
Every classroom has a screen showing what class is what time at that room


This place is huuuuge

Uni students can just pick up laptops ready to go with their student card lol
Like to borrow for the day or smth
And since most data is on the cloud you can easily just work through that
That's putting it mildly
- Nem, ez val�ban nem lesz egy gyerek j�t�k.
*Sz�lal meg a tiefling is mik�zben a f�gg��gy�n �cs�r�g*
- Szerencs�re a mostani hib�nk nem lett v�gzetes, de egy nyom�s lecke volt. Minden esetre rem�lem, hogy   ez el�re seg�t minket a j�v�beli az egy�ttm�k�d�sre.
*L�bai keresztbe teszi majd enyh�n el�red�l kezeivel t�maszkodva l�b�n.*
- Austin tal�n a legj�rtasabb az alvil�gi egyezked�sben. Igaz eddigi �letem jelent�s r�sz�t fektettem a pokolb�l kijut� l�nyek visszak�ld�s�be, de nem mondhatom hogy sokat besz�ltem volna b�rmelyikkel is, nemhogy alkudoztam volna vel�k.
*S�hajt egyet miel�tt folytatn�*
- Sz�val e t�ren jobban figyelek majd a javaslatodra Liadon.
\- Az biztos, hogy �vatosabban kell vel�k t�rsalogni. Lehet, hogy minden devil �lma feljebb m�szni a rangl�tr�n, de egy rossz l�p�s kell, hogy visszaessenek. Az �rul�snak el�nyei �s h�tr�nyai is vannak.
*Kicsit alr�bb s�t�l �s oda ad egy kis kulcsot Rash-nek*
\- Nem lesz mind hajland� el�rulni a feletteseit, m�g akkor sem ha hatalmasat ugorhatn�nak. Lemure-r� �s Nepuribo-v� v�lni senki sem szeretne.
*Elindul a fed�lzet fel�*
\- Magatokra hagylak, igyatok egy te�t. Rash tudja mi hol van.
(akik �ltek az elm�lt k�t napban valszeg l�thatt�k Koh-Tam-et "Akci�ban". Nem esett t�lz�sba, egy Merregon (legion devil) megpr�b�lt felm�szni a haj�ra amire oda se n�zve mint egy b�ra hozott felette �t�letet �s mintha felforrt volna a devil miel�tt kifacsarta volna valami l�thatatlan er�.)

J�v�k ki a szob�mb�l, r�n�zek a takar�t�n�re mik�zben z�rom az ajt�t �s k�sz�n�k hogy 'j� reggelt'
Erre
R�m n�z
Is ilyet sz�l hogy 'no, no close' xD
Keverve azzal hogy magyarul pr�b�lja meg�rtetni velem hogy ne csukjam be xDDD
�n meg ott �lltam hogy most tud van nem tud magyarul vagy mizu xdd
Azt hitte nem besz�lek magyart pedig eg�sz biztos vagyok benne hogy j� reggelt k�sz�ntem xD
Wow xD
Kinda cute tho xDDD
Azt�n kezembe nyomott egy m�sik kulcsot �s ilyet sz�l "*ha t�nyleg magyar vagy* levinn�d ezt a port�ra?" XD
XD
*ha t�nyleg magyar vagyok*
Aztakurva xDDDD
xdd
***prove yourself bitch***
Tess�k h�rom er�s Pist�t mag�ban megenni ott el�tte
Ha ez kor�n t�rt�nik velem akkor lehet v�laszolok neki angolul hogy "Don't worry I'm Hungarian"
*Milyen j�l besz�lsz magyarul*
Igen? Magyarba sz�lettem �s n�ttem fel, k�sz�n�m
"Ha elmondod angolul nagyon sz�vesen leviszem"
XDD
Wow
Megmondom neki hogy am�gy brit �llampolg�r vagyok vagy valami csak sz�rakoz�sb�l magyarul is megtanultam xDD
Confuse her even more
XDDD
Yes xD
Naah
Poor fucker azt se tudta hol van szinte xD
Szerintem nem is hallotta hogy k�sz�n�k
Az�rt hitte azt hogy nem vagyok magyar or idk xD
Vagy hozz�szokott a k�lf�ldi vend�gekhez
Most hallom hogy mes�li a port�snak xDD
Konkl�zi�: Aki ott van az k�lf�ldi, aki k�lf�ldi az �tver, teh�t te nem lehetsz magyar �ll�t�sod alapj�n se. XD
Ye sure let's go with that xDDD

<@&1307302474109161505> Tervezt�nk a h�tre session-t? I don't remember.
elvileg igen
m�stmint m�lth�ten volt tails

At least not yet
well not yet
de m�ltkor mondtad, hogy lesz chains

De sajnos most el�g g�z a mel� helyzet :/
Tudok lenni csak k�sve
6ig kitolt�k a munkaid�t
<:catcry_peasantversion:1052945999196344360>
Ah oof
Akkor a h�ten szerintem pihi, azt�n j�v� h�tre szervez�nk valamit.
H�t
Idk
:((
Nagy a k�osz itt
Lehet j�v� h�ten is ugyan�gy leszek :c
Nem baj. Majd ahogy alakul �rtes�tesz minket �s �gy tervez�nk
sz�val most valszeg lesz egy h�nap kihagy�s?
Egy m�sik opci� a szombat irl ha mindenki szabad lesz
can work
Dude. No xD
well 2-3
ha a szombat nem j� senkinek
A h�ten nem lesz. J�v� h�ten megtartjuk, egy hi�nyz�val is.
Am�gy van 4 j�t�kos addig megtartom a session�ket, kiv�ve ha fontos a karakter r�sz�r�l van integral lenne a karakter az encounterek-hez
Pl final bossfightokat nem fogok ember hi�nnyal levinni. Ahhoz igenis kell mindenki
obviously
az a 20 perc Rash n�lk�l m�r alapb�l hal�los volt xdddd
pedig el sem ment
I just sent Endre the plans for the Avernus ending bossfight
:/
Szombatom necces
P�ntek 6ig mel�
She was stunned for a single round and that got one member dead xD (yes I shall blame Rash)
Vas�rnap is 8t�l
Elbaszt�k j�l a szabad h�tv�g�m :/
�h it's the only free day of yours
Nem sz�vesen adn�m fel ye
Akkor nvm no sesh this weak
Maybe tomorrow?
Sunken lesz holnap
Lehet holnap szabim lesz
Ja t�nyleg
Alrighty akkor nvm
Egy kis pihi. Addig tudok mappokat �sszerakni meg let�lt�getni mindent amit szeretn�k
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
akkor addig rp?
Am�gy j�v� h�ten se hi�nyozn�k, csak k�sn�k
So dw
I still have a whole adventure site and a multi stage bossfight to make in foundry.
Alrighty. Addig Nym kicsit csendesebb lesz. De majd �rom mir�l maradt�l le, hogy ne legyen nagy kies�s.
A szombat nekem fullon nem lenne j� btw de m�r mindegy is xD
Kicsit elvesztem a t�meg m�g�tt erre bazdmeg majdnem r�mcsukta a sof�r a buszajt�t xdd
Kurva bocsit nem tud kiny�gni a bunk� fasz

I mean it really isnt. Hungarian bus drivers can be really fucking assholes
I ran into like 1-2 memorably asshole ones and a bunch of kind ones
And memorably asshole was like "talked rudely cus I didn't have change"
Most are nice
Assholes like this are memorable bc they are rarer xdd
Tapasztalataim szerint
Ye well megk�sz�nni nem fogom neki hogy odacsukott majdnem xDD
Szerintem nem vagyok disproportionately upset
Nem hiszem hogy egy bocsit nem �rt volna meg a dolog xd
They are just non-chalant
That's not exactly the word I'd use
They are like oh well another day another slay
Ink�bb leszarom volt
XDD
*Fair enough *
Heyheyhey
Look who it is
oh yeah
start when?
<@463641084971712514> Nym mennyi id�s??
Why?
We're looking at how many events Austin lived trough
Aaaaah
Alrighty
Since he was born in 1013 he saw quite the history xD
He is older than Luskan, the Zhentarim or the Lord's alliance. Older than Sazz Tam or Saramaster
XD
Or Drizz's for that matter
Okay but did he live through it all or was he dead for most of it
?
*Rash megk�sz�ni Tam-nak a kulcsot majd az elfre tereli figyelm�t. Miut�n v�gzett kijelent�s�vel, a tiefling l�tsz�lag nem zavartatta mag�t a sz�r�s tekintettel, mondanival�j�ra viszont egy el�gedettebb mosollyal reag�l els� sorban, majd felkel �s egy kis z�rt szekr�nyhez l�p amit kinyit a kulccsal �s elkezd kipakolni bel�le egy p�r te�s cs�sz�t*
- Teh�t nem paktolt�l le vel�k a m�ltban. J�, ezzel m�g lehet dolgozni. Rem�lhet�leg nem csak az eml�keid vesztek el r�la.
*A cs�sz�ket lehelyezi a kis asztalra (7 cs�sz�t tett ki amib�l 2 saj�tja volt)*
- Az el�z�ekben arra pr�b�ltam utalni, hogy tal�n jobban ismered azt az �szj�r�st ami egy '�zlet' megk�t�s�n�l kiskapukat tehet el�rhet�v�.
*T�bbiek ir�ny�ba n�z ezut�n*
- Valaki tud vizet forralni? Addig el�szedem a marad�k hozz�val�t.
By that I mean did he die recently
He was born while Waterdeep was expanding from a small city state into a metropolis
He died recently
I see
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
By elven standards Nym isn't too old
Approaching 400 probs
I can't remember if I had an exact number xd
But you can't really tell xD
I don't remember it if you had one either
Zinzana is the youngest of the elder races
*Didn't know they had metros there* XD
I also wanna rework the story a bit
And she's almost 300 as well xD
So idk how much u told Reg�
Nada
Semmit xD
It might change a slight bit xD
Thats why we asked
Alrighty
Elveb standarban Rash csak egy hot headed child xD
Now you know why he doesnt like her
Nah, I have no idea xD
It still fucks me up that our stories are 20 years off from main timeline xD
So it turns out Austin isn's just at the closing of his 5th century, he already passed it by a few years
Austin with the 300 year long edging streak

Guys
Meddig akarunk pihenni?
Csak mert Zinzan�nak legal�bb 3 nap k�ne
Akkor annyit pihen�nk, no?
Oh yeah igen. Az, hogy meddig maradtok a haj�n pihenni a csapatra van b�zva. Annyit tudtok, hogy Baphomet k�zeledik �s nemsok�ra �rkezik. Nem tudj�tok pontosan mikor.
I mean addig utazhatunk m�g pihen
Megk�zel�tj�k a fegyver�nek hely�t
Milyen messze van kB?
I mean tal�n ilyenkor tudn�nk kicsit felder�teni p�r helyet, ha �gy van
Egy nap �s el�rtek a legk�zelebbi ponthoz. Ut�na Koh Tam szerint kb 3 nap s�ta lehet. 2 l�h�ton.
Also can we get maps of the layerd?
Sure at 9 I'll send it in again or ping it if I find it
But also, maps are unreliable. Distances are fucked here
The bronze citadell is behind you, but also in front of you. As is the flow of styx. It flows in both direction but neither at the same time

-It has been a day or two since I had the chance to set my eyes upon a warforged, let alone one with your deisgn...

Koh tam tudja hol van a 
- Bronze Citadell
- Tiamat's Lair
- Gate to Dis
- Pillar of Skulls
- The War slough (a Verem)
Uuh. The pit
Ami biztons�gos �s sok mortal l�togatja for sone reason is the pillar
"biztons�gos"
(Engrish)
(I prefer englisheu in rps)
(But it literally doesn't matter, sometimes i feel hungarian comes more naturally)
(Not today tho xD)
*He glares at Austin with some uncertainty whether to answer or not, and a slight annoyance.*
-Let's say.. Ruined. Wretched. Ungodly. The "design" is nothing more than abominable.
*He hisses.*
-Quite unique though, so that is a great observation. And I hope nobody will ever get to see another like me. 
*He flashes the elf his metal teeth trough a bitter grin.*
"You have a better chance at finding pure evil in elysium than law in the tennari's ranks."
Ha gondolj�tok egy short rp session-t tolhatunk valamikor a h�ten ha a csapat �gy d�nt, hogy Zinnie l�badoz�sa alatt szeretn�k megl�togatni a pillar of skulls-t
<@&1307302474109161505> az se gond ha nem j�n mindenki, mert csak rp lesz. Akik nem mennek azok a haj�n chillelnek egy napig
Fine by me
(Austin menne Rash-el besz�lni vagy hogy gondoltad?)
(Vagy � m�g ink�bb elker�ln�? xd)
I'm free tomorrow after the guys are done putting my AC up. Let's say it would take an hour of rp so... Around 6 tomorrow? Anyone who's available and wants to rp can join.
Ha k�s�bbre tenn�nk kb 7re akkor lehet �gi is tudna csatlakozni. (maybe?)
<@463641084971712514>
*Austin nods in agreement.* -So you would say It is not fortunate that you ended up like this? What happened?
7es kezd�s is m�k�dik sure. It won't be that long
-You were an elf too, right?
Kezdhettek el�bb nyugodtan �n meg majd �rkezem valamikor xD
Dis seems so fucking fun xD
Aaaaa
I was about to say *what* but u literally mean Did xD
*fuckin layer names*
I love the AI reading the book
-Fortunate?
*He also steps closer to Austin, almost chest to chest as he glares down, all three eyes wide open.*
-No, I wouldn't say so, you got that right.
*He says, keeping the sick grin as he speaks.*
-Tell me, what's your assessment, Liadon? *What* do *you* think happened to me? 
*His grin widens even further, despite the supposed rigidity of his face.*
-And were either of us ever truly elves?
Jangleling Hither is Sus....

I read Hitler instead of Hither
Honestly same xDD
*Hitler is sus*
Yeah
What is Jangleling Hither? XD I know the word 'hither' but jangleling
Is that even real? XD
It sounds like someone butchered changeling
Or was it supposed to be 'jangling'?
Oh yeah it's jangling (look I didn't read it I only listened to an AI assistant butchering it xD)
At least right now

Most likely can't tho ye cause work
Next week
hello. can we finish at 19:00?
I mean, if we're at a point ingame at 19:00 that doesn't require all players, i guess we could continue without needing to stop the session at 19:00, no?
Akkor family h�sv�toz�s fog zajlani
Ah igen, megkaptuk nagyp�nteken �s a h�sv�t h�tf�. Ami am�gy munkasz�neti nap xd

Hey guys, I just want to make an announcement for the future so it doesn't hit anyone as a surprise:
For any ***future*** games I will run I'll __require__ everyone to have a camera turned (it will also be noted in any reqruitment posts) on as I really enjoy it with our test group in Sunken Isles even if not everyone is there.
This can be your phone's camera propped up somehow, or a simple 3-5 euro HD webcam, no need for anything fancy.

This does not effect any games I currently run, as I won't be changing rules like this under people's feet that's just rude.
Nika birthday incoming in 3 days
Would you pepo like to get together?
Nika has been talking about a Vault raid a few times
Amd she won't be available for the weekend or the days after sadly xD
:c
How will I pick my nose now D:
Joke aside it does sound fun!
I don't like having a camera on
I'm meh about it
I'm not a fan of it being *required*
Cause I like your campaigns
But I don't want to use a camera
https://tenor.com/view/sad-cat-gif-6906939104301495025
have you played with a camera before?
or you just have a bad feeling about it?
Haven't played with a camera before, but I know I don't like video chat
I just generally don't like being beholden

Chances are you'd see me make '_' this face about 90% of the time
it is fine if you don't become like super animated
Yeah
but it is just really fun to sometimes point around with stuff, or see reactions to sudden events etc
Noone can expect anything
I am not as averse as I was years ago but I am just generally disinterested
I don't even look at you guys XD
When online
Only sonetimes
*Watching people is not my favorite hobby*
And you guys go do that
*I can barely see anyway*
I'll sleep on it a few + the next game will be a bit further away still, but yea
Maybe I'll get a camera, but no promises
de ha �gy szeretn�d futtatni, don't let me stop you
I'm more lenient on not being that strict towards it for smaller games, but for my epic campaigns I do want to have it

*I won't even show up to sessions* XD
*I die*
you are one of the most reliable people on showing up to session ***including ones you are not even in***
xDD
Hopefully that'll stay that way even when I will have busier days in the future

<:UwU:959931778905276456>
Alright, akkor visszem a poraidat D�niel
Hek yeah
Mikor kb akkor?
we still use a similar program called `Radmin` with friend
we had a factorio lan through it during last summer on our vacation, was rad as hell
Meg meddig mert pl Bence 6ra j�n vpbe
Nekem is olyan 6 k�rny�k�t�l m�k�dne
Meg hol �s hova?
So laateee <:scorpioemotionaldamage:1237447864758566992>
H�t ha tali 6t�l akkor nem lesz�nk sok�ig, legal�bbis �n nem, nekem haza is kell m�g �rnem
We could push it earlier and have Bence join when he arrives
De f�l 5 el�tt nekem es�lytelen sajnos
Ha pedig menni szeretn�nk valahova akkor meg kellene besz�lni �s foglalni is kellene
A magic item cser�t csak az�rt mondan�m ink�bb egy retconnak, mert a patron�knek p�nz a magic item beszerz�se + id� ha nincs list�n
Nincs se p�nzetek, se t�bb hetetek megv�rni am�g beszerzik amit szeretn�l
Meg tal�lniuk kellene vev�t az ijjadra, ha nem akarsz teljes �rat fizetni a crossbow-ra (az ijjat ami mivel haszn�lt, csak f�l �ron tudn�k eladni.)
Complicated and just eh. Better to just switch it instead. We're still at the beginning of the campaign, mistakes happen
Gondoltam sarevokn�l van a r�gi cucca, csak lehetett volna n�la egy
De ugye az oathbowt v�lasztotta
Nincs r�gi cucca. Sharrans have most likely taken everything he hoarded up
He has nothing and is a nobody at the moment.
Csak a bow volt ott. Vagyis a fegyver ami n�la volt mikor meghalt. Semmi m�sa nincs m�r sajnos.
Same with Rayana and Nym too
Alright
5 akkor?
�s mondjuk f�l 6ra egy Johnny's foglal�s?
M�r ha tudunk xD
That would be nice yes
Ut�na meg felmehetn�nk hozz�m egy kis chillel�sre.
Perhaps
<@618475228695232532> <@152824369805131776> <@377469395007438849> <@520697326679883808> 
F�l 6ra egy Johnny's raid, egy lehets�ges pip�z�ssal ut�na?
Sure
Nekem 6ra �r be a busz elvileg
That works
Legfeljebb  Johnny's n�l nem leszek m�g ott azt�n ennyi
Az a f�l �ra alatt az se biztos, hogy megkapjuk a kaj�nkat xD
Ha megmondod mit k�rsz rendel�nk neked is, mire oda�rsz meg lesz az is, v�rnod se kell majd
<:point:951578243415302235>
Yi yi
Akkor f�l5re vagy 6ra menjek be?
Nem hat
5
F�l5 vagy 5 xD
?
5 az j�
5 t�jban tali a buszp�ly�n
F�l 6 Johnny's
M�r ha lesz hely xDD
Okay j�

<@520697326679883808> Te tudsz j�nni ma vel�nk Johnny'sba?
Szerintem k�r�nk egy nagyobb asztalt azt�n ha nem lesz�nk annyian, akkor annyi baj legyen
Mark �rt hogy lesz
Sz�val 7re k�rdezem max nem lesz�nk ott mind ya

*Austin withstands Nym's stare, his own lips turn into a smiliarly crazed and greatly amused smile. He didnt expect the warforged to be upclose and personal out of nowhere and it clearly caught him slightly off-guard, regardless him being entertained by it.* -Now that is an inreredting prospect for sure. *He tilts his head a little and looks Nym up and down.* -I suppose certainly not the elves our ancestors wanted us to be, but the elves we aspired to be.... You seem like the person who did what needed to be done in order to get the job done. Cautious but firm... *He runs his gaze all over the living cascet of adamantine carcasse as if inspecting a relic of ancient times.* -Reliable....Hence they had to make you into something more....conservable... *He then shrugs and takes a step back with a more relaxed face.* -Tho I can be wrong of course, not my intention to make wrong assumptions of others.

(Me likey the big metal abomination)
But not in a good way
-What? *He asks, as if he didnt expect the attention of the noble elf and he wraps his arms behind his head, while lying comfortably.* -Need some help? *His voice is slightly patronising but his tone comes off genuine enough.* -You sure you can work in such conditions? You might snap some brain cords or something. Usually it helps if you just rest it out. Your body and soul still needs to get use to being snapped together again.... *His behaviour seems all too calm and matter-of-factly, not at all the same when the, first met but similar to his snarky remarks, yet it feels more...sincere.*
*Her eyes of daggers poke at Enwir, as her fingers too that point rudely at the aasimar.* -Fancy pants always mean trouble.
- I have a certain air about me, one could say. It follows me wherever I go. 
*He pets the rat's body.*
- But at least life is far from boring. *He chuckles in a forced manner on purpose.*
- And I have good company whenever I am with you.
*He stretches a bit in his seat.*
- Anyhow, I did not mean to derail the retelling of your lives' events. Please, do continue.
*He asks with unfeigned interest.*

� I appreciate it, thank you, but I need no help.
*She glances at her spellbook, then back at Austin, eyeing him up and down curiously before sighing.*
� Rest is overrated. I need to work and train harder so the previous incident does not happen again. Besides, previous night's rest was refreshing enough for me to continue work.
*Zinzana takes a non-bladed fan out, and begins to gently fan the ink on her spellbook's paper so it dries even faster.*
� Hopefully, with the help of this spell we won't die no more. I will also likely finish another one of my half-done copies by the time we step off this ship again.
*She speaks calmly and confidently despite how exhausted she looks with her dark circles under her bloodred eyes.*



(*Rest is overrated*. Says the bitch who needed 4 days of rest just for the adventure to continue)
*The Liadon smirks and stands up like it's on que and steps to lean closer to Zinzana.* -Well it certainly will come handy when the devils start using our own strategies against us. *He chuckles quietly and goes around to check on the book from Zinnie's side.* -Which spell is that?
-r 1d20+8+1d10
(DC 15 arcana, hogy megfejtse a spell alapjait)
(36)
(you know the basics of the spell and understand the main effect it should do. The specifics are beyond your expertise)

Circle of Power btw
*He leans in, examining the writing and the name a little bit, brows furrowed.* -Ah, that one. Whats so special about it?
Alrighty
� Circle of Power.
*She breathes, glancing at the spell's pages.*
� I could have finished it days before, I simply wished to add my own flavour to the spell. It required a good amount of modification and time to accomplish it.
*The girl lays her eyes on the moon elf now closer to her. Raising an eyebrow, she flashes her fanged smirk before continuing.*
� Imagine having little to no complications when dealing with other magics and spells in a battle. Avoiding a fireball with no burns, even if you were in the spell's bullseye. Not having to worry to about Synaptic frying your nerves. Laughing when the enemy attempts to Dominate you, because your mind's defenses are fortified. All, as long as you're close to me, in this area of safety I'm holding up.
*Her smirk widens.*
� And I can carry this aura of protection into the heat of battle, to you all, as I am a trained combatant as well.
-I'd prefer Intellect Fortress, since I'm always in the backlines...But I guess this works too. Although we already have someone who can give us some boost against such effects.
(Fun fact: there's no intellect fortress in 5.5e xD)
(Thats sad.)
� This boost if far more superior. It can also do most of what Intellect Fortress can do, though not all features of it, of course.
*She nods as she continues.*
� However, you are not wrong, Sir Liadon. Circle of Power specializes in boosting multiple parties at once, while Intellect Fortress is better if only one person needs magical assistance.
*Zinzana tilts her head as she adds:*
� Well, in mental protection, I must add. Circle of Power not only helps the mind, but the body as well.
*She stares at her fancy quill, letting a heavy breath out.*
� I could go days long into spell comparison discussions, though I assume you do not wish to be bothered by that. You are here for somethings else, I presume?
(I'm pretty sure both Austin and Zinnie are older than 5.5e to know what Intellect Fortress is xD)
(Austin probs knows some of the 3e spells too)
(Yeeaaah)
(Austin is older then 1e)
(XD)
(both of you are older than 1e)
(1e was 250 or so years ago?

*Against her own will, Torielle blushes, hazel flocks flowing over her shoulder to frame her burning cheeks. In order to save face, she scoffs and flicks her head to avert Enwir's gaze.* -I always had to get them out of trouble. Those two were as thick as they came, always scheming and causing mayhem....Tch, if it wasnt for me they would have spent all their time in the corner, being punished and getting less to eat. *The ship groans and the elf's limb tense up as a loud thinder follows the crashing of a big wave. They both have to grab onto something to prevent themselves falling over before the ship finds her footing on Umberlee's hair.* -Oh the Bitch Queen is mad....
*Austin raises his brow, looking puzzled, not giving away much of his alleged befuddlement, or perhaps his consealed ulteriors unbeknown for Zinzana.* -What makes you think that? *He asks unknowingly, yet a small grin starts forming at the corner of his mouth, showing amusement.* - I just figured I'd take some leisure time myself, you just happened to be in the exact same space as me. *He says, speaking in a more familiar tone like the night Zinzana first met him. Honied, glazed word, can not be mistaken from a nobleman's way of speech.*
*He's only seen the face of Torielle shift into something other than stern only once, so he savors the rare occasion with glee, his chest filling with warmth, but it is short lived as he feels the ship sway way more violently than it normally should. He secures himself to his seat, which is properly fastened to the walls as it should be on a ship, and quickly holds his hand out for "Torielle" to grab hold of.*
- I will surely have a coin for her if she lets us live. *If the other takes his hand, he pulls her down onto the bench, close to him.*
*She wouldnt hold it intentionally, but refusal is merely a thought as her delicate hands, grab onto Enwir's, firmly. After thigs slowed down a little she reluctantly releases, her finger lingering for a little longer just to be sure. Torielle's face is dark and depressive, her hair fell into her face like a veil of woe.* -You can only beg at her feet to perhaps grace you with her mercy upon you....Like that Night of Ruin, when our bonds severed from each other. Everything was dark and ominous, unnaturally quiet and gloomy....
*She gathers herself and for a split second Enwir can see Illigens, pearly eyes swift through Torielle's persona.*
( :(( )
*The eye on his forehead twitches ever so slightly as his grin vanishes.*
-The only thing you got right  is that I did do what had to be done.
*He steps back half a step and begins eyeing the other from head to toe before speaking again.*
-The noble elf, Zinzana, spoke of you potentially having your memories stripped away? And later you confirmed some of that saying you couldn't remember her.
*He states, changing the subject seemingly aimlessly.*
*His smile crumbles from his face by the sudden change of topic and by the subject of it. His face is unphased but he puts his weight from one leg to the other, uneasily.* -That is ture. *He answers, not saying anything else to see where the warforged is going with this.*
*He lets go when they deem the ship safe to traverse. The sea's humid, salty air mixed with the moisture of his skin has loosened some locks of his hair, which idly dangle along his forehead.*
- Begging does not befit me.
*He replies, quiet enough as to not rudely cut into the woman's next words. When he catches a glimpse of Illigen's ivory gaze, he tries to gauge how conscious the shapeshifter actually is. He can only hope that talking about that cruel night will finally set his mind free... but that sadly seems to be wishful thinking.*

Megpr�b�lok foglalni a vaultba helyet. Akkor 4en lesz�nk igaz?

# Homebrew Rules

**Casting Interruption.**
-# (this is just a homebrew rule we have always been playing with but was never an official rule / never meant to work like this)
- If a caster takes damage during/in reaction to casting a spell they have to make a save as if they were concentrating on a spell. On a failure follow standard rules for interrupted casting (action lost, spell slot is regained).

is this something that will be used here too? (just as I know u guys play on a somewhat/pretty closely followed dnd24 rules)
I think we could use these. We use the second and first one is something that would make sense

Will we have everyone today?
That would be great B)
Izzy is questionable cus she has afternoon shift
Ah :(
nobody else said they gonna skip yet so I assume everyone else is coming
Szombaton v�rnak majd minket

� Well, you just happened to walk in on me working a few minutes ago. Perhaps because this is the first time on this ship you intentionally approached me while I was alone.

Nem is tudom milyen kor�n k�ne mennem hogy be�rjek reggel VPbe a nagyon korai vonatra :'D
H�t
F�l 8as a vonat ha leszarjuk a kapunyit�st xD
Sz�val annyira nem rossz
De kapunyit�sra nem tudn�nk oda�rni
F�l 7kor menne vonat ha "id�ben" ott akarunk lenni xd
Vagy megpr�b�lhatunk buszozni
We can go with that, get breakfast and then go
A magad nev�ben besz�lj :'D
F�l 7kor indul� vonat... nem is tudom hogyan �rn�k be r� :'D
Kor�n
Sehogy
4:55-�s zirci indul�s� busszal k�ne elindulnom innen, ami azt jelenti hogy legk�s�bb 3:55kor fel kellene kelnem
Es�lytelen i'm sorry xD
Seems reasonable
Nem
Be tudsz j�nni ide VP-be is el�tte est�n
Ha nem musz�j ink�bb nem, a Gan� miatt xD

Sorry for reviving the long dead room
There is a small thing called Gaiz and Orimvia that could affect the lore and events of chains (or the ending later on, we'll see)
Question is, what should we do with them? Did the oota team actually go down into the abyss to permanently get rid of Gaiz? With making Nikita the Lantern angel Gaiz would have known of their arrival, but the party would have known all schemes of his.
Options:
- Gaiz has been killed
- You run a side tangent to kill Gaiz this campaign 
- Gaiz is in some unfortunate trap he can't escape from for the rest of the campaign only emerging somewhat weak during the aftermath
At least imo
The easy way out is to just say they killed him during OotA in the Abyss
Orimvia too
�s akkor nem kell ebben a kamp�nyban is Gaiz h�lyes�geivel foglalkozni
Probably the easiest yeah. The party had more than enough beef with him. And he had no tools against them with Nikita being there
Or like... Ever again xD
(who tf is **Ori**mvia?)
XD
His grandmother. An archfiend
*Ori, high demon overlord*
Dealing with her would be easy in chains
I guess that can be a nod to end the line if she'd fit somewhere
Zeuss would probably help kill him
Wouldn't be hard to include her in all honesty.
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
Nika has no access to this room?
Oh
She was never part of the homebrew process, yea
Only ppl who work on the world has it
Fair. But she is part of the current group setting lore discussion
Yes my thoughts exactly
Vannak m�g early bird jegyek?
We could change this room to closer to that. Including group FR lore and changes it has.
Mondjuk
Probs not
*Mennyi egy jegy?*
Cuz we changed a whole lot of the lore
Or should that be a new room?
Wdyt?
Thaisil eredetileg az �v� volt
KILENC EZER FORINT HAAAAAAA
I guess
??
Ki�?
Thaisil nik�j� volt
�s �tadta endr�nek
Igen ezt mondta
Nik��, ha j�l eml�kszem, csak azt�n volt a DanNika dynasty falling out
�s ut�na Endi vette �t
Ja
Cant read
Nik��. Yeah. Discussions here started after we left with Nika
"�t adta" egy kem�ny sz� erre But yes
What? Why?
Mert az azt mondja hogy valaha is besz�lt�nk xD
Cuz it was more like "Way too many dissagreement and abandoned project"
+that
Jaa
Yeah
Its blurry
Endre felkapta �s tov�bbvitte
Oh gosh, no offence, it was a pain to even listen to the original idea/how much hate for it were there from some peeps xD
R�g volt m�r, nem is sz�m�t igaz�n. Ouria is in a good place right now. Even if some of us mostly run games on official FR grounds
Oh am�gy a szob�hoz lehetne csin�lni egy �j role-t �s azt kiosztani azoknak akik lore discussionoznak, �s megtartani a Makers of Ouria rolet mint legacy role
Meg technikailag Lotti is r�sze, Estana-val
sure
Itt van a szer�n?
nem
m�r purge�lve lett
Lul
aszem
Honestly az nagyon ilyen limboban van orsz�g �s mindenki csak arra piszk�lja amire akarja xd
Csak sz�besz�d �ltal ismert
Could work yes. We could have main editors and just watcher role as well. With a pdf to gather changes we had, and updating timeline
But yea I get what you mean
Oh also timeline thing I wanted to mention. Please don't include characters in timetable. It clutters the whole table with info most peeps would never care or look for.
It's cool that Austin was born in 1013 but it wouldn't matter in a worldbuilding sense. Write it in the sheets or something. I do he same
XD
Could work. Cuz current timetable is a mess
Estana egy t�k j� kamp�ny setting lenne, ahol a bad ending-ben el�rasztj�k az istenei az orsz�got XD
I mean even rn you can click a few buttons to get them filtered out
�s azt k�ne valahogy meg�ll�tani
Which one? Cuz only have access to the copy which hasn't been updated since forever

Ah. I missed that.
Np, happy to help :D
old as fuck XD
Shapers be like xd
Nincs
Yes
Should we get a day to add stuff into it?
Cuz a lot happened since it was edited I think
https://tenor.com/view/yoda-star-wars-gif-8063259
Edit the file we must
<:scorpioemotionaldamage:1237447864758566992>
Yea we can, preferably sometimes after next week
(I'm a bit full on this week for sure, next might be the same)
Sure. I'll gather what I can by next week
Hey hey hey hey!
J�v� h�t kedd vagy cs�t�rt�k kezd�s
Ok�
Kedd
Cs�t�rt�k chains
Ink�bb kedd
Nem �gy volt, hogy t�ltel�k adventure?
Amikor �ppen elmarad egy m�sik session
Or was that something else?
We'll skip this week's session, i'm not gonna be able to present anything to yall, been quite distracted and exhausted lately
Aww
Alrighty
Hopefully u get some good rest in then <:pipsimheart:1266023104035950605>
I still don't have a character...
It's oki, after how the pob Finnish went I 100% understand xd
Huhhh
Campaign ends are so hard T-T
I have my sheet ready, just not the backstory
We're craving irl sessions and irl rp
Yep they are
I usually stumble cus I overcomplicate them
I have nothing, no class, no backstory, no ideas
Start without me and maybe if Mark is open to the idea, i may join later once i have *something*
Don't worry about that much. My tip is that ending it in a simpler way is better with an extra session for after campaign events and such. That would be my favourite I think
Beating the big bad, saving the world and hm... What to do with the city?
Damn
You guys will be the key point in which way Rachea's future goes xD
Its sad to hear but alrighty
I know which way I wanna go it
Thank u for understanding
And Satoru actually wants the same so it is fine
CYBERRACHEA!

aaw
cute
<@875753704685436938> v�g�l nem tudod mit j�tszan�l?
azt hittem m�r k�sz van a karaktered
a cleric tiefling?
�n is azt hittem but i'm not feeling the cleric to that character art
Doesn't matter
Majd kital�lom id�vel
what else would you feel?
Jaja
Someting noncaster high cha something but that's basically nonexistant
Rogue
XD
Rogue is generally more int, but yeah
I have a rogue already
And it doesn't fit with the art (to me)
Idfk tbh
Honestly first tought to that art was rogue for me
<:point:951578243415302235>
Ye
Just saying to that other point, not as an attempt to convince you
The art gives me the maffia boss vibe and idk which class could imitate that xddd
(we also have a rogue in the team already)
Rogue
akkor kik lesznek a cs�t�rt�ki kezd�sre?
XD
Sorry no xD
Rogue is not a maffia boss
�sszedobok valami sztorit
Not for me
Rogue is the maffia boss' favourite assassin
You really limit your imagination to the main class image don't you? XD
What
I'm happy to announce I have burned an esp32 by plugging it into my laptop xd
Ja
Well idk
(it's a small chip)
I just don't imagine rogue for this one
Not this one
Vibe is not rogueing with this one
Fair enough.
why dont you play a warlock?
Doesn't vibe the "getting power from a higher being" with this one either xd this man got his power thru his own hard work and climbing the corpirate ladder xD
Okay that's too cyberpunk
Eehhhh
Yarrr
This is what i'm saying, i'm not feelin the things
pirate
Nooop
Why would it be? XD
He not a pirate either xX
Idk
Xdddd
you want to play that character?
the tiefling?
Yeah
*corpirate*
Or yall wait another month till i birth a new art
*you said it, not me* XD
ELIRTAM? XD
Damn xD
h�t ak�r hogy n�zem ez ink�bb egy rogue. vagy glory paladin
https://fixvx.com/SketchyMouse/status/1911604332111216853
M�g tal�n egy barbot tudn�k faragni bel�le
But idk
Karizmatikusabn fighter
Battlemaster
dani is a fighter
Most csak a karakter maffiaf�n�k �tletre mondom
esetleg valor bard?
meg kezdj�k ott, hogy honnan j�tt?
Waterdevian?
Nem mintha a maffia vezet�je nem lehetne egy alapj�raton fizikailag wimpy, de ment�lisan top szem�ly
I don't want another spellcaster next to Zinnie
*looks at austin*
Nincs semmi backstorym
h�t akkor els�nek azt k�ne megn�zni, hogy ki is �
mert ha waterdeepi akkor m�r jobban lehet �tletelni hozz�
I could make a Kaz Brekker out of him tbh
A backstory az uccs� aminek neki�llok xD
A legt�bb vezet� �ltal�ban nem a k�zfej�vel oldja meg a dolgokat XD
thats the problem xd
Of course, doesn't hurt to be built and intimidating, but that alone won't make you someone who can lead
mert azt �rtem hogy egy feel-re csin�l az ember egy artot
csak a k�zben pl nekem ki szokott alakulni egy k�p a karakterr�l
Now that i think of it, he could be a Kaz Brekker, the campaign is full the same
hogy honnan is j�hetett
meg ki �
Nah, nekem el�sz�r legyen meg mit akarok j�tszani �s hogy n�z ki. Ut�na hozz� faragom a backstoryt
Az nekem nem megy ha a backstory dikt�lja mit kell j�tszanom
de ahhoz meg a klasszt is �gy alak�tot ahogy akarod
�rtem am mert l�tod austinnal is ugyan ez volt a baj xd
de bele lehet magyarzni dolgokat hogy alak�tson a vibeon
�s akkor tal�n azzal a kklasszal is el tudod k�pzelni
most pls Aust rogue helyett stealth archer lesz
szinte ugyan az csak m�s feature�kkel �rem le azt amit eredetileg akartam a rogue-al
Yeah but still, ki k�ne tal�lnom mit akarok j�tszani xd
yeah ezen dolgozunk
who is this guy?
A book's main character
Six of Crows
oh six of crows
Yes
yeaah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab4FS_6pZLk
only for good measures
The guy who carves the eye out form the other guy because he stabbed his crush in the stomach
I love Kaz Brekker
But the thing is
He's an asshole
A true, real asshole
yeah but youre not playing kaz
T-T
I know xd
again
Austin
same issue
*But i wanna call you all my investments*
you can
they might just not take your word for it
depends on the team
if we are all beginner criminals
then sure
they can work together
*What a great leader to follow* *Definitely wouldn't revolt and try to overthrow at the first opportunity*
*Read the damn book* xDDDD
Nu
Hmph
I'm sure the writer made him be the most badass boss ever who is feared and whatever
Ehhh yes and no
It's not cringe
Imo
And a little respected because leading by only fear leads to everyone being paranoid
And that's not good for organized crime
Kaz is the paranoid bitch actually xd
so
berserker?
NEEMMMTUDOOOMMMM T^T
girl
whats the issue?
its just a 1-5 lvl adventure xd
The issue is i don't know what i wanna play
its not a life long campaign like chains
just roll with it
It's not that easy for me
i know bc its not that easy for me either
If i don't vibe i won't feel, if i don't feel i won't like
but thats why you make the backstory first
cuz now i have like...3 different backstory ideas
Nekem nem, nekem a backstory annyira harmadlagos hogy azt el nem tudod hinni
that could fit for 2 of my class ideas
de akkor nem egy karaktert csin�lsz csak egy �tletet.
hogy csin�ltad meg kuweit? neki is van j� backstoryja
Kuwe'inek el�sz�r art-ja �s class-a volt
Ut�na kital�ltam hogy aasimart akarok
�s ut�na k�r� �rtam a backstoryt
Same with Zinnie 6 years ago.
Same with all my other characters
alright
i understand
Minden GM-em tudja hogy el�sz�r artot �s classt adok
�n barbot warlockot meg paladint mondan�k
ezek illenek hozz� szerintem
f�leg ha Waterdevient
Mik vannak eddig? Milyen classokat j�tszanak az emberek? Dani fighter, yes?
(Thief) rogue
Alright
fighter, rogue �n vagy pala vagy warlock
de ha v�lasztasz azok k�z�l akkor k�nnyebben d�nt�k �n is
*No pressure XD*
Okay akkor se a melee se a cha main character nem lesz j� xD i see xDDD
Akkor szerintem majd visszat�rek egy �j arttal
de cha main csak a pala van a sorcy meg a warlock
Ye i know
Hacsak nem lehet megk�rni a DM-et egy kis homebrew cser�vel
Megleszek
cha barb�r
https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cassalanter
tess�k
backstory
you can be a runt
or something xd
Nem fogok cha karaktert hozni ha valaki m�r v�lasztott cha main classt
Majd igazodok
�s ha intb�l castoln�k?
Megoldom
�gyes kisl�ny vagyok
am�gy is int focused warlockot j�tszan�k
j�tszan�l akkor paladint?
Nem tudom, look, nyugodtan j�tssz amit szeretn�l, nekem m�g nincs semmim kital�lva, majd igazodok, t�nyleg
Nem tudom nem biztos
Mondom
Nem tudok semmit
Csin�lj nyugodtan amit a sz�ved k�v�n �s majd �n igazodok hozz�
akkor majd az �j arttal megn�zed milyen lesz?
Thank u DiceGod
Yeah majd az �j art ad nekem vibe-ot
ok�s
legy�l l�ny
Legyek l�ny? El�g volt a bitchboyokb�l?
well
csak mondtam valamit
nem felt�tlen mert pls az a tiefling art nagyon bej�tt
Well, sorry, hogy nem tudtunk mit kital�lni
Nincs semmi gond, n�lam az ilyen gyakran el�fordul
Mikor �ln�nk �ssze holnap?

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.




Sounds like a threat ngl

Funfact: did you guys know that 2024 paladin now requires a god?
They funnel power from gods just like cleric.
(we probably won't change anything, just found the change)
Lame
Honestly it was weird to me it didn't require one in the first place soo xd
Lol
It was the power of belief and code
It technically needed a god but not directly
Like they supposed to be crusaders and holy warriors of gods. And in previous editions you could get devine powers by just deciding to get so
Most are holy warriors to gods
But not all
Some just represented the code they believed in
Disconnected from a specific god
Yeah but it's still weird to me
Let's say Kromer from limbus company
I'd say she'd be a paladin by her own right
She has a strong dogma, a "holy" quest but no god
(*ofc bc there are no gods in that universe in this sense but let's ignore that* xD)
She simply wills the power needed by fanatic belief
A paladin <:point:951578243415302235>
They were bros who believed so hard they popped a magic vein of something
Also
I tought about the monk damage negation and let's say that if the full damage is negated, it makes the attack work like it missed. No rider effects and such
They usually followed a god bc that deity was closely related to the dogma or code they believed in hence it helped them strenghten their faith in themselves with the aid of a divine being who actually believed in their cause
their oaths aligned with the god's tenets
so
its a win win
They did. Every edition had them pick a god, just like clerics, except 5e for some reason
i think its the alignment system that effects it all
It's like the warlocks. 5e warlocks learn their powers and never lose them. In every edition before 5e warlocks lost their abilities and needed new patrons if the one they had forsake them, or they died
It's 5e messing with lore of classes to make it easier on the player side
Yeah, but they still needed a god. They had to put down an oath to a deity that matched the alignement of the oath.
ah
Then the god gave them light to smite the evil of the land
yep
Yeh that makes sense to me. It was weird to get an infernal wound from an attack I deflected completely xd
Yeah but believing she has a special quest and has a set mindset doesn't give her special power to smite the everloving shit out of things. (she can still hit em pretty hard tho in the name of her justice xd)
Well sometimes they get power from a god that aligns with their oath I guess
The Triad probably rants a whole lot of paladins power
Well yeh that would also work. A god that just approves your work even tho you dont follow them for reasons.
But still it's a sort of devine intervention. My point is justice warrior doesn't equal holy warrior xd
Fair enough. Works both ways, some DMs are sticklers for these to keep lore consistent, but in all honesty, if you and everyone else has fun, it doesn't matter all that much.
If they believe it's holy enough
<:point:951578243415302235>
And if it further strenghtens the religion and power of god then its even better
(Beeboo)
Im not saying they shouldn't, or anything, I'm just saying in my head it would be a pre requisition, but anyone can flavour it the way they want, not gonna argue about it
(Helo)
(damn xd)
(it's been really busy, I forgor)
Funnily enough i think dnd is mostly about serving a higher power either way
(I'll write once home)
Or like contributing to the events of the universe through divine means
(I know its okay. I know you can forklift now)
<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
In some ways ye
In most ways xD
(certified forklifter)
I mean most of the classes require you to serve e diety in some ways
Clerics druids paladins
That's all really xD
Okay honestly i cant think of class or a character in lore who wasnt favoured by a god
I mean classes can be favored but they don't need to serve a god
I guess thats epic fantasy for ya
Gods just like stuff xD
No but mutual respect and work is requiered.
You only need to believe in them and if you pray to them somtimes you will get the afterlife you are looking for
If you don't show any faith... Well damn. You're gonne have a rough time
(and Pantheon from lol walks in glancing at a god speaking. 'Is that an insect I hear?" xD)
Pamtheon would be a demipower himself so he has no need for it of course xD

-Everyone was fast asleep already, when we decided to operate the mission of running away. Everything was great until we reached the back door, past the kitchen... *Torielle gathers herself and brushes her hair back, still pressed and weathered.* -It was when Illigen tried to pick the lock that all went black. Commotion arose as the windows and the front door crashed down on the dormant dreamers of the orphanage, turning their innocent dreams into a hollow nightmare of doom and death. We took a run for it but the boys got caught by the monsters of the night out of nowhere. It was that prideful moment when I decided to go back inside and try to find the others to help them, yet I got lost in the shadow, not knowing where I'd end up. A tall an lanky shadow took Whiskers and Illigen and they threw them into the cellar...Soon smoke arisen from the kitchen as the cacophony of childer's screams filled the midnight sky....

We start in bookpalace, go to nyugati after we finish and head straigh to the food place how bout that? Or we bring food with ourselves and we can delay the lunch with an hour or two so we can walk into a few shops in westend (i wanna visit the Flying Tiger and the Hobby shoppeu)

I do not care
That

Dunno if M�rk will allow the old genasi

So would you allow genasi <@377469395007438849> ?
From multiverse yes. But that is still old edition with old edition spells.

So... it doesn't work here i can't play them
Imagine if Scorpio had to have Aren physically next to him in the team, and everyone else would have just been cool with him, aside from Scorpio
Ughhh �jratervez�s 2.0 then
He'd have to have his tormenter physically there, killable
Sz�val vagy �, vagy Aren meghaltak volna, vagy ki lettek volna dobva a csapatb�l
Scorpio was chill with Aren for quite a long time, they became really enemies when Aren consciously started making Scorpio's life a nightmare
But it doesn't matter here
This is not Scorpio and Aren
And honestly now i'm really fully out of ideas
This sounds horrible without context, i meant "i do not care" to "i don't care if i have to deal with hate"
Sorry i didn't specify
I didn't mean it as "i don't care about your character's trauma"
Okay but back to topic
I'm out of ideas
I don't know when i will have any again
Do you still have your character list? I might be able to help with figuring something out
I do but idk

Not really vibing with any of them
Also it's been a long time since i last updated this list
N�zd m�n ott *A moree*

What's the deal with North?
Wdym?
She's that neon orange woman
Not vibing with her anymore

Its whatevet
Csak pont egy olyan karaktert csin�ltam akinek az �lete �s a szem�lyis�g�nek meg a kult�r�j�nak a r�sze az hogy nem b�zik a genasikbam
Its also just based on basic FR lore

Sz�val �n is j�l belev�lasztottam
You can play genasi
Its not a big deal
Beletraf�lt�l kb. az egyetlenbe ami probl�m�s lenne a csapatnak
Nah it's okay, i told you to play whatever you want i'll morph my ideas around the party
Tal�n m�g ha Xanthar-osat hozn�l, azzal esne a karakterednek Dani karaktere

Dunno, air vagy fire genasi
I'm not gonna play a tabaxi xd
Classra gondolok
I do not know yet
I just had a pretty visual aesthetic in my head
Oh is that so?
Yes, as i said, visual is the first thing i make xd and it would've worked with genasi pretty well
It coould work with tiefling too but i'm still not too much into the tiefling atm
Go for air then
Tariq especially hate efreeti
Also he is pretty much chaotic neutral (nem tudom a t�bbieknek ez mennyire j�tt �t) maybe NG
So hes down to compromise or just let things hang
The Calimport rebellion is still ongoing so if Nika picks a genasi from there, who wants the freedom of the humans and other races it could ease Tariq into the friendship
Yes
Its just that it depends on if you are from Calimport or Memnontar
Ha nem ugrik Tariq neki, akkor rendben van
Nah
He knows he is not in Calimshan anymore
Mini lore drop for Nika: Calimport was taken over by Genasi overlords who enslaved every other race there. Rebellions are a constant thing. Also: Colorful arabian fabrics \:D
He is just weary and cautious cuz he know how destructive genasi can be
(of course. They erradicated 60% of the nongenasi population in the whole nation)
But since genasi are so fucking rare on the Sword Coast
Nika could say anything
So like...he might be originated from Calimshan but grew up here
On the Eastern Heartlands or something
In Silverymoor or something
Is it? Its been over by now i think Tariq is just not aware
One thing for sure, i didn't plan on bringing a challenging personality xD
I want to play a nice person
A Chosen of Ilmater helped them overrule the warlords
Not Kuwe'i or Zinzana with their egoistic neutral asses
And when he disappeared peiple just went full apeshit and drove them off into the desert
The team is so fucking chill tho
Cliffhanger dgas and Ox is just....Ox
Tho i will be honest, me as Nika am not that familiar with FR lore as much as all you guys, so i will likely not dive too deep into ingame politics and suck
Yeah, as long as you're not some  city guard, we ball
SUCK?
Or a Xanthar-er
I don't suck :P
It doesnt matter tho its just me and daniel, mostly
Me neither
Just makes sure to read so.e stuff about waterdeep
Am�gy mikor lesz a k�vi session?
De az olyan n�pszer� hely, hohy m�g ingame is majdnem mindenki tudna mindent
Hacsak nem valami Ten-Towni redneck vagy vagy k�nai
Kedden
<@377469395007438849> igaz bani?
*Not nika thinking about bringing someone who originates from Kara-Tur*
Do it bitch
Im sure Waterdeep is such a big fucking trading state
That literally anyone has passed through at least once
Also its the Amsterdam of Faerun
Everyone is accepted and tolerated
And everyone knows that
So
One more reason why our characrers wouldnt necesserally have beef
You spent most of your life in Kalimshan and then the Feywild but sure
We'll see, i need to make a character art first
Yeah well
He is a knowledgeable noble
De nem eml�kszik mikor volt utolj�ra itt
One of his ancestor was probs a pasha-priest
Yes
P�r �ve tanult a v�rosban �s ut�na meg p�r�vre elt�nt
*Az 500 �ves 16 �ves*
Naah
Szerintem 5 �s 10 �v k�z�tt t�nhetett el
Az�ta nem volt ott csak mivel a Feywild megzavarta az esz�t
Ez�rt rohadtul nem eml�kszik hogy melyik �vben is volt
De ne agg�dj, agyilag is ugyan olyan megragadt
Every vampire romance novel ever
Ew
Let the Right One in
Interview with the Vampire
What We do in the Shadows is the best in this XD
Yes
Circle of Stars my beloved
Dudu?
Oh heck yeah
Air genasi stars dudu
Nice
Alright we came full circle
I MEAN NO
We could use some healsies if that's in the dudu card
We didnt cum
Circle of cum
SHIT
NO
STOP
I will cancel you
XDDD
Omg yeah we do xd
*M�gegy csillagszem� juh�sz*
We really need someone who has at least healing word
So this time i will be the sziloplaszt of the team
Pur Hab
Yes
Do you remember rain?
Peg legged hoe
Yes
*It's currently falling here from the sky*
And why wont SHE be cancled for this??
Cuz i wanted to write that exact same response i just stopped myself
Because I'm not being crude
Fhuuuuck
Could we please have a little redeisgn of the original art piece?
What?
For the arab boy
We'll see i barely have the will to pick up my pencil nowadays
I'm already stressed out of having to make a new charactwr art
XDD
Alright
No pressure
Am not at my best nowadays
But we can return to it later
Its okay. What happened?
Nothing basically
And basically that's my main issue xd i'm also feeling distant, not connected, alone
Too much time i have in my head
I'm running in circles
Chewing on the wrong thoughts
Letting go of the ones i shouldn't
But i'll get over it
Eventually
Oh how i know that feeling
Trying to fill the void with the bitchboy characters i make xd which is also not a long-term solution
Yeah but you will need some outside perspective for that to happen
No but it can help to distract
It just reminds me of how miserable i am xd
To each their own
I never needed it
Everyone needs it every once in a whilr
I know what my problem is but my solution won't walk in my front door
It's not a universal thing
Some people just deal with it internally, and get over it
It kinda is. Its just everyone is changing in their own pace
Depents how much self-awereness one posesses
I'm just saying, not everyone needs someone else to talk about these things in order to solve things
Internal things, not interpersonal, of course
De nem ez l�nyeges most
Not but it can help to reevaluate
Nika tudja mi a gond eredete, �s am�g dolgozik azon amin tud, addig mi pedig itt lesz�nk, l�togathatjuk, elmehet�nk helyekre
Watch movies together
Ye. I was just saying that it might help more
Whatever
Or you walking out and looking for it?
What i was trying to imply
Yeah ain't happening, don't have the social skills nor the charisma nor the courage
Nor the confidence
Az nem ezeken fog m�lni, hidd el.
A magabiztoss�g az mas, yeah
The only thing i have at my aid is social anxiety

Oh

No its not
And there are exactly 4 big rooms with one smaller for NPC's
Well damn that's a really nice find
There is also a 3 bed room
For staff
That was what I meant by the smaller for NPCs
Or guests
Ah
Okay
Akkor mehet a szoba stoppol�s?
Vagy dobunk
�s az alapj�n sorban v�laszthatunk a 4 szob�b�l? XD
Eny�m a tehenes vagy a tet�t�r
Akkor dobjuk le. Roll for init Anna
-r 1d20+3
AAAAAAA
-r 1d20+4
Wow xD
Kapsz guidence-et
Megv�rjuk m�g Ann�t azt�n folytatjuk
Nope I'm rolling against you
No guidence for thine enemies
<@520697326679883808>
Majd
Yes she can roll higher than you so we wait
I would appreciate the one with the big bathtub
Since 7 foot tall
-r 1d20+5
You pick first
I like this one but no bathtub's there
Same problem for me
I guess we could convert another smaller room into a communal bathroom
Don't imagine those as real bathtubs. Those are probably moved arojnd the house filled with water and such
Jaja
V�gom
Ink�bb f�rd�lavorok
Fine then
This is my pick
Alternatively, the other this shaped room
B�r ann�l az �gy l�b�n�l l�v� kandall�/kaz�n az para XD

Id loved the kandall�u
This one also has multiple rooms with one bathroom that is for everyone
Wooh thats weird
But i like it
What is weird about it?
I like the other one
Ki� lesz az iroda?
Hogy sokkal nagycsal�dosabb xd
It's a tavern xD
The newcomer i guess xD
Or i get the couch
Or we could go on voice one day of the weekend to decore it in some app or something
And pick rooms

Like these peeps
I have dungeondraft you know
We could build one from ground
I could help you all with that
Or in inkarnate
ALTON????
The layout is set. We just need to copy, and decore it \:D
It's one of the most common names that name generators drop for me for some reason
Not the layout, but like the beds and such
I know. That would be cool
What kind of rooms do we need? A meeting room for sure, the tavern, personal rooms, a bathroom and what else?
A treasury maybe xD a safe
But other than that
Nothing else is really needed
Would you like to edit the map one day with us?
Yes sure
Cool thank you
m�g miel�tt nagyon elmer�ln�tek a dolgokban l�tnom kell hogy mit is takar a faj �t�r�s
m�g nem b�lintottam r� semmire
Yeah, sorry
Csak m�r szerett�nk volna d�l�re jutni xd

Here you go
Based on the elf heritige and mordekainen
Cantrips can be taken away if you so wish, cuz that is a bit extra over what elves get now. The rest is built up like them
Air got holding breath, not speed increase
And honestly i prefer holding breath
Air has 35 base movement instead of hold breath
Since when?
Since mordekainen?
They have been rewritten into 4 different races

They not "Genasi (water)" now but "Water Genasi"
Yes, and they got (it was the original too) holding breath
This is old
This is the multiverse one
I know, I just picked the one that is "better".
Akkor rosszul van feljegyezve az alkalmaz�sban.
I have the pdf open here whoch has 35 movement speed
I'm sorry but i don't believe this, air genasi never had increased movement, they **always** had hold breath
-Now, you see, understanding of your inner truth is still not a moving force in my opinion but to each their own. And not wanting your soul to rot in hell, well that's just obvious, isn't it?
*He smiles faintly and shrugs.*
-But a need for *change*, now that is something. 
*He clicks his fingertips together as if snapping but instead they reverbarate a light metallic chime.*
-Can't be too great of a change though, considering how the solar's feather turned to ash between your fingers. *He feigns a pout for second before his amused smile returns.*
-Not a great person, are you, Liadon?
*He seemingly enjoys poking at the moon elf.*
Dude xD. Listen. Mordekainen Air genasi has increased movement speed and hold breath. I picked one for these, cuz 2024 races stripped some abilities to keep it equal between lineages, and I picked the speed, instead of the breath. You said you'd prefer the breath I swithched the speed to it for you.
M�g amikor neten r�keresek a multiverse-es air genasira, az increased movement mellett ugyan�gy ott van a hold breath
....
Do you
Nem olvastam m�g el
Read what I just wrote?
Mkst olvastam el
But like
Hold breath is so much more air genasi
Xddd
Icewind Dale-ben is az volt nekem
Here I meant the one I dropped in here. Not the Mordekainen one, if this is the base of the confusion
Yeah yeah got it
Csak ja, a 35�s speed olyan lame xd air genasi was always about hold breath
But yeah
I see you changed
It
I did yes thank you
That too
XD
Nekem a water-hez a cold kicsit egy�rtelm�bb lenne, de v�g�lis water dilutes acid
So why not
But acid splash
So now i just wanna ask Mr. GM if he agrees or not <@377469395007438849>
Why not ice knife or something like that
Ice knife would be pretty strong for a built in race spell but honestly it'd much more dope
Na! Ha mindenkinek megfelel akkor j�tszhatod, de viszont neked is mondom, hogy a backround pontok nem mozognak
lvl2-re kell meg�rjad akkor a karaktert
That was what they had before. I didn't switch it. Marits have both cold, acid and lightning. Genasi writers picked acid. It is what it is
Oh I meant the resi by the second line. The spell is also in mordekainen so I gave them that.
Gotcha, thank you
Personally I'd have chosen cold, but
kedden probs nem lesz session
that's just me
ha csak m�r holnapra nem lesz meg egy combosabb lista, hogy mit szeretn�tek csin�lni
I only edited a few things. Took away air bonus speed, took away earths bonus action cast but gave it false life instead (they were the only ones with 2 spells instead of 3 like the rest.)
No balls you say?
Nah man if you feel like it's too short of a notice, we can skip it.
- inform�l�dni, hogy jelenleg hogy �ll a faction/gang war
- k�r�ln�zni valami �rdekes mel� ut�n
- k�nyvt�rban olvasgatni magic itemek-r�l �s a t�rt�nelm�kr�l + hogy �ltal�ban mi mennyi�rt megy
im saying its a bit much
- ki�p�teni kis hidy helyeket a h�zban, ak�r padl� alatt, ak�r valami m�g�tt ahol stash-elni lehet helyeket
but im not saying no to a may1 sess
May1 is tails
And other saturdays will be chains sessions most of the times.
Two's days are free tho
true
- tal�n megkeresni Volot �s azt a k�t m�sik tagot, k�rdez�sk�dni, hogy pontosan mir�l is sz�lt ez az eg�sz elrabl�sos dolog
arr�l majd lesz sz� k�vi szessionon
csak tegnap m�r le akartam z�tni a ch1
azt�n nem jutott r� id�
- Van-e valami nagy durran�s/ �rdekes t�rt�n�s a v�rosban amir�l kb. mindenki besz�l
sok minden t�rt�nik a v�roson bell�l
azt megtudj�tok, hogy a xanatarosok �s a zentarimosok most nagyon egym�snak vannak fesz�lve
nem tudni mi�rt
a b�za�rak emelkednek mert van valami a v�ros hat�rn�l
�s ez kb mindenre kihat�ssal van
(dr�gulnak a dolgok)
I'm sorry <@886672003396927530> but I gotta
xDDDD
They not ready yet
There is no laser trex thank you i love my character i don't want to lose him
Don't worry it wouldn't target you
It is looking for the high priority targets
From 300 feet
I wasn't the high priority target with Nyx either. Nor with Ziki.
Ziki was the only target when she died. She stepped in it's reach solo.
Nyx well... Basically same thing xD
Nyx died to trigerring aoo
Grei �s Arden is a T-Rex mellett �lltak k�zvetlen�l
Engem konkr�tan teljesen leszart
Nem c�lzott r�m egyszer se
I think you dealt less damage than Nyx or Grei. + aoo
I don't really remember, it was a long time ago
Igen
I dealt less damage
I know that when Nyx died she was almost alone in the room. Maybe you guys backed out to get healed?
Azt eddig is tudtuk, engem az �rdekel, hogy valamelyik�j�k most k�l�n�sebben gyeng�lt-e
Maybe
�n nem
Mert engem nem sebzett
Ha j�l eml�kszem
It's hazy
Akkor lehet a robot miatt amit a v�ll�ra k�ld�tt Ulhar?
Nyx sebz�se akkor nagyon durva volt alapj�raton
Ennyi
Grei volt a m�sodik legnagyobbat �t�
�n meg voltam
azt nem fogj�tok megtudni
I really don't remember. I know that you were kept for a later target, grei seemed too defensive to target, ori wasn't a threat at all and Ulhar was out of reach because of you 3.
nem olyan info amit elmondan�nak
I think the bite forced the trex to keep targetting
Nyx
cus otherwise that releases the grapple
Oh yeah
Nem olyan amit elmondan�nak, de lehet �rezni ha m�r nagyon egy ir�nyba halad
That might be it
It also has to target different character with the tail attacks so I must have targeted the others as well
Especially after Nyx went down. Ments�gemre sz�ljon, Nyx-et technikailag a class �lte meg amit v�lasztott
Sz�val mosom kezeimet xD
*Nem vitted le 0 HP-ra*
XD
*De igen*
I know bro
Joking
Nem kell magyar�zkodni
�rtem
Class kivett minket abb�l, hogy seg�thess�nk rajta
Me too. I'm glad something good came out of it in the end. Even if it was sad at the time
nah
this one aint
its a gang war
and the onlyone's loosing are the civs
Xanthar has a lot of men and basically unlimited recourses as they are nested in the city pretty well
The Zhent is around the whole continent with also almost unlimited recourses
So we don't have to worry about either one XD
They are just fine

*Austin looks confusedly at the construct elf like there is a misunderstanding but lets him finish what he has to say, then he pulls his brows up and tilts his head in question.* -What are you trying to get to here exactly? *He looks dissatisfied like he truly doesnt get what Nym is trying to imply here.* -Why, what do you think? *He walks closely to Nym once again like the warforged did last time, with a blank stare but his aura is electric and verberates with pure concentrated blackness, like his cold space emalgamated with his shadow to the core.* -Just so I get to ask that as well. *His poise and stature is something delirious yet enthralling at the same tim, like a sleep paralysis demon, uncomprehencable yet a graspable form.*
(I know, i know its edgy. Honestly i feel kinda insecure now that i sent it)
(you can take it back if that's the case. Or edit it)
(We all edgy dw xD)
(I'm n.... I'm everything baator right now. Okay fuck I take that back. I'm the edge.)
(Like im doing too much and its just cringe by Nym is way cooler than Austin and he will just play him like a fiddle)
(And also im just not good at this character and ill fail and everything i do is jhst a big failure)
(Anyways I really enjoy them tho xd)
(I just have my concerns atm fsr)
(I think u doin great <:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>)
(Yeah but I feel intimidated and Austin isnt and so Nym is going to just fold him xd)
(Which i wouldnt want i just want to come out the bigger guy for once)
(Im venting. Sorry, im anxious xd)
(Just gonna say. Yes but no. Rogue Austin got no chance but I think fighter Austin takes Nym 5 out of 10 times easy. They are equal, in lore and in mechanics.)
(Ahhoz lehet t�l �ntelt, high and mighty karaktert hozott mindenki hogy Austin legyen a "bigger guy" xd)
(Oh yeah, no joke(
(we all match each other's freak)
(yupp. This happens when legends band together for a quest.)
(Which just makes me insecure rn)
(just do as you do and don't back down if he wouldn't)
(Yeah i just wont want arguments
(Although it might still occur)
(Alright. Im curious what he has to say)
(Im just not sure how much he should tell just yet)
(And i dont wanna mess it up. But ofc we talked about this yesterday)
(This is like the really fresh justice league that has an overseer put fucking... I don't know... Joker on the team xD)
(don't worry that much. Rp will flow. The whole party dynamic, the characters everything will evolve. If you tell the main things now big deal, new things will come up with time. Just have fun. This is just a game, always was and always will be, whatever your noggin' wants to tell you.)
(Alright. Lets go lets go)
Kin�l is van a Zythian sending stone?

Yall know what to do
Which one is the character
https://youtu.be/-BE6GyHcASE?si=VCDRoB7R6DqmfPec

Oh
My
God

I just had
The fight of my ttrpg carrier

It all started with a random mission to clear out an ogre camp. Sure thing.
We going there slice up a good few ogres, quite a big camp but they are falling easily enough.
We find the ogre boss, we are a bit beaten up, 6th round of combat (every person in the party operates on 1 minute buff spells which is like 15% of our power). Eh we can take him down in 4 rounds *for sure*
We couldn't, it's fine, he is though, hits hard, but we have healing and dealt with the adds mostly.
Ranger goes down
*fuck*
Okay she stabilised by herself, good deathsaves
I'm bloodied so I start to kite the boss who's under slowed 1 from the magus, survive another 2 rounds taking solo while the magus finishes off the last two adds
*I drop*
*Magus misses two spellstrikes* (basically nulling 2 of their turns)
I stabilise on the ground from lucky deathsaves
Magus on single digit hp
Hits spellstrike
Boss "Near Death"
Boss crits Magus onto the ground
Boss starts rushing away as Magus is doing deathsaves
All of us: ??? wait gm, why?
*Boss suddenly dies from the 2 dmg/turn persistent damage I put on it like 5 turns ago* (he was rushing to get the health potion from his tent but due to slow didn't reach it)
*Magus is still rolling deathsaves*
*Magus is still rolling deathsaves*
*Magus is still rolling deathsaves*
*Magus is still rolling deathsaves*
__*after 18 death saving throws the Magus stabilizes too*__

We woke up next day like we were just the sole survivors of some insane afterparty
Gondolom eddigre m�r sejtitek de mi majd Feh�rv�ron sz�llunk fel xd
See ya peeps soon <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>

I have a gray shirt if it gets too hot for the cardigan. But it's not the fancy shirt, that's casual as well
No fancy shirt it is then
Merre �lt�k kb?
Its so nice here
"Gyere a f�nyre, annak nincs felt�tele." - My mom's strongly christian aunt

Ill go out jeez
Okay i sound like an emo
18 death saves? How does that work?
xD
*nincs felt�tele*
What xDD
*If it's a metaphor and you start telling the truth, see how conditional everyone gets* :_d
Idk...anya mondta hogy annyira szeretne velem majd besz�lgetni... and im just...its either genuine or she will try to convert me or something
She always made me uncomfortable for a while now
Honestly i hate it so much when someone goes "i wanna talk with you" because by the time we get to that talk i already ate myself away from the inside thinking of what did i do wrong of because you wanna talk with me
Just... if you wanna talk, just approach me and talk, to say it beforehand, it's the worst fucking nightmare anxiety experience when you tell me you wanna talk with me
�n azt *szeretem* amikor valaki �gy �rzi, hogy entitled ahhoz, hogy amikor azt mondja, hogy besz�lni akar velem, akkor besz�lek is vele
De att�l hogy te akarsz velem besz�lni m�g nem biztos, hogy az �rz�s k�lcs�n�s
XD
Ink�bb csak ha valaki �gy phrase-eli, mert �ltal�ban sz�vesen elbesz�lgetek b�rkivel
Mintha ez valami k�teless�gem lenne
Exactly xd
Idk i just have a feeling what its about and i hate it
I hate feeling like im something to be fixed
Or repaired
It just like I should feel ashamed and emberrased and change myself just bc they say they love me and try to help
Like this puts me in the position of believing im weird or non-normative and i should just put myself in a box
That doesnt feel comfortable
Maybe im overthinking again but i have a feeling she wants to talk about my sexuality and mental health
Csak ebb�l meg az j�n, hogy �ssze k�tik a kett�t, amiben van igazs�g, de nem az�rt mert az miatt vagxok ment�lisan lerobbanva xdd
Hanem miattuk
And im just overwhelmed and dont know what to do or how to process it
Its hard to live my own truth when i dont even know anymore sometimes, especially when there loved once who think opposite to your reality which also try to connect with its an important part of your personality but it just feels like the two cannot co-exist
But you don't have to talk to her, and if you don't and she's truly a person of 'light', she should not force it either
And thats the reason i should either choose one thing
Yeah but im just so frustrated from the get-go, i dont wanna explode on anyone
Just say: Nem szeretn�k
De am�gy mag�val a besz�lget�ssel nincs bajom, csak ezeket a felvezet�seket ut�lom
Meg a hozz��ll�st
�n sz�vesen meghallgatok m�sokat
Fontos hogy tudjuk ki hogyan �ll dolgokoz
Akkor csin�ld �gy. Hallgasd meg azt ami nem t�r bele az �letedbe, �s ha elkezd olyan ir�nyba haladni a besz�lget�s, mond azt, hogy bocs de nem
Nem szeretn�l a priv�t �letedr�l ilyen m�rt�kig mes�lni
Mert az nem r� tartozik
I just feel like i could try which idk where it comes from
Like even rn i feel like i could just shout and break down in tears like: "Leave me alone I dont want this"
My impostor syndrome does not helo euther
Always having that voice in the back of my head, saying that im just lying to myself
:)))
No wonder i feel so out of touch with reality and myself these days
Ungraspable sometimes

Yeah, fair
Egyet�rtek
Honestly...fuck it
Lets get outa here

Special occasion disrespect XD or I don't even know what that could be

I just wanna live beside them peacefully without getting upset
Faterod nem is akarja
Imagine, some people can just be like that, be chill about someone else's personal life even if they themselves don't go for that lifestyle
It would be nice
:))
Acceptance and unconditional love to your fellow man, like you know, how a certain *not very well known* son of a Carpenter taught people to do
But no, why would anyone listen to Jesus when you can just take the easy route and go testy and scorched earth on people like Old Testament God xd
*If you guys sin too much I just genocide your entire race, the one I created myself, basically my children*
And the ones who believe in me I will put through the most horrid events and trials because I want to make myself feel like they love me more than anyone else
Yes
*Because I am God, I am number 1, and if you Me forbid love your son more than me, then you fail, but you were ready to sacrifice him because I told you so so I guess you are okay*
Like bruh

No, its basically mass manipulation
The book fandom has been at the fandom wars for more than 2 millennia
Like every religion just on other degrees and others actually consider you as a human individual
Yeah
Unlike christianity thats all about community and survival
You know you are fucked when someone quotes God from the Old Testament
Oh yeah
I dont mind old trad teaching but when its extreme
Its...not always good
You can be an extremist in a peaceful way
Or like
But when it's extreme it's not good
Yeah
Lehet szab�lyozott az embef
�n ez�rt szeretem a r�gi hagyom�nyokat, mond�sokat, tan�t�sokat
Nekem semmi bajom nem lenne a vall�ssal
De mint minden m�s ha az ember beleny�l csak elrontja
Mert sokan �nz�ek �s azok a leghangosabbak
�ltal�ban
Then you'd still probably be unbearable, because who wants to talk about anything with an extremist xd

Itt a szl�vok meg amerik�ban az angolok meg a norv�gok lesz�rmazottai

<@&1307302474109161505> so someone found a but of info about how outer planes affect spells. Would we want to have these kinds of effects in the campaign or should we let old edition restrictions rest?
He'll be simpin
Probably not just him
Borlan too
Ill be simpin
Everyone will be simping xDDDD
TARIQ
Good xD
XDDD
Me too probably
But
:33
Borlan likes them a bit older.
Im a nerd

Probably Lene too
We'll see what her personality is
A "B"? Maybe a "C" cup
Oh
I mean I'd love to hear them first
alrighty
Sounds interesting but if it really fucks the game then maybe no xdd
Oh damn I need to collect them from specific magazines.
Some are flavour, some are buffs some are nerfs but some spells just don't work at all
Alrighty

https://youtu.be/u6EuAUjq92k
Wish i was good at it
it is not for that, just, watch stuff like this, and each will slowly give you nuggets of understanding
Have you been practicing?
Ugye a Weave minden plane-en m�s
Yupp. But main things are:
- Summoning from other outer planes is a no-no, especially celestials. Rituals negate this, but are heavily monitored except when summoning devils.
- Sending and other telepathy related spells always sound muffled and like someone is whispering alongside the sender
- No charm or domination works on archdevils
- Imprisonment doesn not work on archdevils
- Magic circles and similar can't hold devils but physical restraints still work
- Secret chest only opens on Avernus
- Rope trick's hidden space is in the layer of hell above you.
- Detect evil and good radiate evil, but you can pinpoint things that are "more evil"
- Ressurections can fail (skillcheck needed)
�s a m�gia m�sk�nt channel�dik rajta kereszt�l
Okay reading them now they are almost completely negative
I listen to videos like this basically every day, this is how I know stuff
each video gives me like a small little bit of knowledge towards the topic that gonna stick in the subconscious
little bit multiplied by 365 over a year is suddenly actual knowledge
No thank you :D
Yeah �gy �tn�zve szerintem is sok xD
�pp el�g, hogy a teleport�ci�k ennyire korl�tozva vannak
Flavour changes I might include tho. Those are fun
the sound visualisation for deaf people is insanely fun
like GOD DAMN
I like these
Oh and paladin + cleric turn effects from channel divinity never work on devils. Every other fiend and undead are still fair game tho
They are good, but we suck enough already xD
The dissing is strong with this one
Yrah, csak �rdekes, hogy eredetileg mennyire korl�toznak a Plane-ek a saj�t szab�lyaikhoz
Yupp. Majd egyszer egy planehopping kamp�ny alatt bevet�nk komolyabb changeket
Teljesen m�s a Weave m�k�d�se.
It enforces the feeling that you are not home here
If dragons get lair stuff, why wouldn't an entire other plane?
And the things native to it
I already have a few changes built in that the party doesn't know about
So it will have that effect, but not in such a harsh way.

i had the same question like 2 months ago
no one answered
I must have missed it
Tho, i also just started playing with it with Rolk�
oh I recognise the visuals, not really my type of game sry XD
It's not that expensive, 9.75 eur
Oowww
:(
lotta money xD
10% of food budget
Understandable, tho this is not your average horror game. It's barely horror tbh xD
Ooof
# I GOT THAT FOR GTFO TOO
# I GOT THAT FOR GTFO TOO
This is like, you gotte collect them valuables while random annoying bitch ass monsters are walking around
They look ugly rather than scary xD

the game it copied is already too horror for me to just have it running on the side as a yt vid
its is like lethal comp�nia
ah yea that one
Well, you do you, it's not a must of course
so yea, this is about lethal company XD
Yeah xD
So
My question was more oriented at the peeps who like funny, dark co op games
<@886672003396927530> <@463641084971712514> <@152824369805131776> maybe even <@618475228695232532>

Sending D pics?
Cups you say? We'll need that for the tavern
Borlan will be running the tavern as a tavern, with a small locksmith sidegig. He will join the inkeepers guild to keep the HQ away from official prying eyes.
Also guys if your characters sidegigs include working of some kind, you need permits from guilds. I know Nika's character might open a small shop in the tavern, selling potions potentially. Just make sure you read up on the appropriate guilds if you have something like that in mind \:D
(majd annyi hogy a h�zhoz �rkez�sn�l lesz RP)
(whoop indeed)

its the neighborhood
t1 is you
T1 is the tavern
Yeah okay
Oh also. Lehet be fog k�lt�zni egy id�sebb h�lgy a fiatal fi�val a fogad�ba. Seg�t majd a fogad�ban munk�lkodva
(thinking)
A h�lgyet Irma Varn-nak h�vj�k, a fi�t pedig Isiah Varn-nak. �k Borlan fogadott testv�r�nek feles�ge �s fia.
<@886672003396927530>
The tavern as a tavern? Wha
The building we got is a tavern
Or like
Ah
Was
Lene would probably not want that
Loud
Borlan would assure him that it's quiet during the day. + It would make sure no officials try to check it out for shady stuff if they are protected by an official guild
Nekem is j� a cs�t�rt�k
Alright
It's quiet during day. What about night?
Brothel
At night it's a tavern
No
That
XD
That's what I was afraid of XD
A michellen quality restaurant
Hacsak nem fogunk �jszaka �bren lenni/dolgozni, �s nappal aludni
Borlan valszeg el�g k�s�n kel� lenne pont ezek miatt.
*Gremlin lookin ass*
F�zni, takar�tani, felk�sz�lni a nyit�sra. Azt�n action. A l�nyeg, hogy az emberek a fogad� r�sz�vel lenn�nek elfoglalva a helynek. �gy ha Sz�rke R�ka esetleg a shady dolgokat akarn� int�zni, lenne mi elrejtse.
Tariq can gather intel
Ok�
Oh oh oh. We could have  VIP section for the tavern like one of the maps.
I don't have darkvision
XD
Where Tariq can bring influental people to that
And stealing by lantern light is... not the best
Goggles of Night?
Brothel?
Do I have the money for that?
Those are acceptable in price. We just need to make enough money first xD
If I don't spend those 10GPs on grappling hooks and ropes?
No brothel xD
I just woke up xd
Cantrip queen over here
Why are you so horny? You want a brothel here, fuck Mystra with Trouble and fuck Levistus with Austin.
The first too are at least somewhat achievable
If he wants a brothel, he can go to one of many within the city
*Mystra will fuck you if you show her a good enough magic trick with her approval*
Tariq the Prostitute
And the boobs, ye I don care for those much. My character is probably a board
More like Tariq the Slaver
Okay, no
*Become like your enemy*
Nika k�rdezte is. "El�l deszka h�tul l�c?" XD
Bean pole
2.13 m tall, lanky, wimpy relative to the average goliath, stone skin patterned, 0 pupil havin', bald, with custom leather armor that has the same pattern as her skin, with some gargoyle wing, claw and decoration motives, probably wears a cloak above that most of the time
Brothel?
I like the old goliath look better than the current one
*Yes, brothel* XD
The one on the left holding the pillar just straight up looks like sea elf Scorpio's long lost half sibling XD
They kinda look goofy

How would that even work? Mystra repairs the weave before Trouble would move a finger?
Like, yes Trouble is infinite and a permanent protector, but still """just""" a lvl20 planeswalker in each of his lives
(also the wild surges are a thing to protect the weave from breaking.)
It was just hypothetical xD
Alright xd I was confucius
Nem a weave a l�nyeg hanem a Mystra x Trouble fanfic
I know that's why it's golden quotes but I was just being Anna for a moment there
Yeah we talked about that part. That it wouldn't work exactly like that
But also
Pulling Mystra is not that big of a feat in all honesty xD
Every second archmage can tell that story already
*Because I didn't take hyperlawfulness from years of overexplaining every rule, every lore tidbit, or anything other*
*I just grew it out of nothingness, manifested it from the void*
Believe me, I only am like this around you guys
Usually I don't care
Same with the sexual innuendos
"being an Anna" -> getting hung up on a minor detail that interests me specifically but probably isn't the point
You think I'm out there being like that with my family or my other friends? XD Hell nah
*Yeah, no one else does that or did that but me*
*I am the one"
But I agree it's annoying
Same, I nearly wrote something real stupid into a job application that I realized in time shouldn't be there xd
I don't want this
It's a detriment to my chillness levels
You are the one who stands out in this specifically for me, I might be wrong idk
Just a quirk like how Reg� puts sexual stuff into any and all conversations
I've been trying to not do it
I wish I could just not care about details no one else cares about
That are mostly irrelevant to the situation
-# (it would've been very good comedic value if Reg� popped something in right at this msg)
It's fine, everyone has their thing they get hung up on, sorry for calling it out
It was meant to be a funny remark like how we have the <:CertifiedRegoMoment:1323270238430560358>, it was a certified anna moment
XD
It's fine
Pr�b�lok dolgozni rajta
That's all good
The sooner it is gone, the better for everyone
I've been trying to be less strict about what convo goes in what room lately too
It takes way more effort than I imagined it would xd
Sidegig t�ren tal�n �rt�kfelm�r�nek, vagy szint�gy locksmith-nek mehetne, tal�n ilyen biztons�gfelm�r�nek helyekre ahov� be kell t�rnie, �s jelentenie, hogy hol gyenge a v�delem, de az t�l nagy seg�ts�g lenne azoknak akiket potenci�lisan ki akarhatn�nk rabolni a j�v�ben, hacsak nem mond el minden hib�t
Majd r�n�zek a guild-ekre

I mean, ami teljes �ras arra lesz 20% kedvezm�ny elvileg xD
<:gobbowhen:1188445136137502770>
Sz�val az �n dolgoz�i k�rty�s 10%om most az els� h�ten nem �r majd sokat xd
They don't stack?
No
Unfortunately not
Our discounts stack with other ones
Ah sad
Yea
It is what it is
Ami kedvezm�nyes arra m�r nem megy m�s kedvezm�ny �ltal�ban
Yeah happens. But I'll go and check the chairs out. I need at least 2 more for sessions
Honestly lehet jobban j�rsz ha egy szettet veszel kis asztallal egy�tt xdd
They are

Hallod nekem �g a pof�m az �rainkt�l n�ha xd
B�tors be like

Yeaa

Probably am�gy a legjobb az lenne ha olyan sz�keket venn�k amik am�gy is vannak n�lam
That would be the cheapest and most asthetic
But that doens't mean I can't visit ya
I honestly don't remember what kind of chairs u got xd

I tried avocado for the first time
It tastes like shit xD
eh
its nothing special
its creamy and nutty
It wasn't even creamy
I tried cuz i see it everywhere, even on healthy food
And like
How can people eat this?
xD
its the vegans favourite
its tasty
It's... weird, and not the good kind xD i dunno
Nem tudtam sokat enni bel�le
My taste buds didn't vibe
Akkor nem �rett meg amit ett�l
az is lehet
Ripe avocado can be spread like butter
Lehet
its usually soft
Almost like butter
This was hard like a cock
And it should be completely black on the outside
No green spots
Ye. Def unripe
:(
In itself it's just the taste of raw *green* XD
try it again with a ripe one
nah its really nice earthy and nutty

I know, but I still think it tastes *green* XD
I mean it does kinda. Mild green.
De bedar�lni f�szerekkel �s cream spread-k�nt haszn�lni nice
The first time I tried real macha tho... That made me understand what green really tastes like.
*Crayons*
*�zl�s? No �zl�s?*
oh yeh
Yeah mine was not ripe... And the sad part is mine was the darkest one on the avocado shelf :(
just grass
Leave it for a few days if you buy one that's not ripe yet. Best is to put them among apples if you have them laying around but just putting them on the counter should work
I've already opened mine up
What am i supposed to do with it?
Apples are like magic to fruits and vegetables that are not ripened yet.
:'D
Yea i know
You could slice it put it into an omelett
No eggies
The only thing I made with avocados that were not ripened yet were avocado fries and they become creamy after cooked
<a:catcry:1052923953741570119>
Lil guy
Won't be the same taste
Totally professional
Ehh
i usually just put it on a toast with tomat and with something spicy with some wiener sausages
We'll see cuz i have nothing i could make these suggestions with xD
No eggies, no toast
Airfrier?
No airfrier
I'll get one once i've moved
Dad said he'll get me one as a late bday present
*It has lil' battery eyes on one side*
*Epik t�kolm�ny*
Now that i got disappointed in avocados, time to eat a mango
(ripe mango I hope)
Yes it is, i was barely able to cut it into little cube cuz it was so soft and juicy
Oh oh
J�n a vihar
Itt m�r d�r�g �s most kezd esni
https://tenor.com/view/ateez-yunho-kqfellaz-im-fine-crying-gif-12436390

Yep
I got more mango on my hands than in my plate
While i was peeling it
I think i got the greatest noob achievement

<@618475228695232532> just noticed something. How much str does Austin have?
8
What kind of ranged weapon does he use rn?
Light crossbow ha �gy csin�ljuk ahogy besz�lt�k
Didn't we switch that to a longbow cuz you can't use extra attack with crossbow? Or am I misremembering and I just wanted to tell you?
oh de
bc of reload
Wlel
Austin is too weak to wield a longbow effectively xD
oh ye
Longbows and heavy crossbows need 13 str
then keep it as a shortbow
sheesh
Heavy weapon property changed to 13 str requirement

Check out inZOI if you're really into Sims recently. The game costs the same as a sims4 expansion and while yes, it doesn't have themed dlcs like sims, it's a much prettier, much more realisting and better detailed game out there
It's early access on steam but it's already super loved by people
I really like the guitar

explanation:
```
Alright here�s an explanation for those who have never read Macbeth.

�Nobody born of woman shall harm Macbeth� is a prophecy given to Macbeth by the witches. He thinks �oh, everyone is born from a woman, so that must mean nobody can harm me!�

Macduff, the one who ended up killing Macbeth, was not �born of a woman� per say, but rather he was taken from his dead mother�s body via a c-section.

C-sections were (and sometimes still are) seen as �not real birth� so Macduff was �removed� from his mother�s body.
```

�There�s one called the Keahi. He�s even older than myself and has many deep thoughts. He can be won over, but only if you truly care for the people of the Isles. You may not see him, but be assured that he�ll be watching everything you do�and don�t do.�
�I fear that hard times have come upon the Isles. You�d be wise to look for strong allies. There�s one whose strength surpasses all other beasts in the Primal Archipelago, and another more ancient than myself. I know not his allegiance, but if he is to help, I trust he will find you.�
�There�s a place called Skyreach at the peak of Kadaur. I cannot tell you much about it, as I�m not allowed to visit, but I can tell you that it holds many, many secrets about the Isles.� � �Kada shares his soul with Kadaur, just as I share mine with Chitoni. Though he�s my elder, I sense his conviction has overshadowed his wisdom. Time doesn�t bring understanding to all.�

�I fear for the Watching Woman, a dear friend who observes all the Isles and their troubles. Her power is far less terrifying than her choice to never use it directly.�

�I�m sure you�ve heard of Kumuhea. It�s one of my regrets that I once worked with her on the tunnels that brought about her doom. She is someone worthy of respect, but she takes things too far. If you should run into her, please tell her Old Shell hopes she has learned from her mistakes. We must all strive, but we should not attempt to grasp too much.�
�I sense the pirate who littered the sea has returned from his grave as a glutton for life. His pride may yet be his downfall, perhaps a stronger alliance could face him swiftly when he�s alone.�

Idk
N�zem
De nem pont azt besz�lt�k m�ltkor hogy felesleges be�rni nyit�sra?
Nem is hiszem hogy 3-4 �r�n�l t�bbet ott lenn�nk
Nyit�s el�ttre ye
Nem �rdemes mert �gyis sor lesz
Van egy 7:30as opci�
De
Ha nagyon g�z mehet�nk 8:30
Csak m�ltkor m�g ok� volt asszem a 7:30as xD
I'm fine with either
i will be honest, i do not remember what i said to that xDDDD
But i guess ha azt besz�lt�k
De amugy mennyit akarunk maradni? H�ny �r�t lesz�nk ott?
Mert ha nem sokat, akkor nem biztos hogy �rtelme van szuper kor�n oda�rni
Eddig ak�rh�nyszor voltam, sose voltam tov�bb 3-4 �r�n�l t�bbet
�n az�rt m�r maradn�k t�bbet mint 3-4 �ra ha kiadtam 9k-t xd
De megl�tjuk
Legyen akkor a 8:30as
Aight?
<:UwU:959931778905276456>
�n is sz�vesebben maradn�k t�bbet de az a baj nincs olyan program ami szabad/lek�tne/interesting enough

Deal :D

We'll sit somewhere and chill
I'd go with 6:30

Sponges are broadcast spawners. Sperm is released through the excurrent opening (not sure what that would be on a walking, talking sponge. His mouth perhaps?), and sucked in by other sponges through their pores. Each of his holes is a potential sponge-ussy.

*His smile flinches and he shakes his head slightly.*
-That'd just make me a different kind of monstrosity now, wouldn't it? Nothing you'd put on this ungodly machine of a body, be it flesh or steel, would make it feel truly mine ever again...
*He averts his gaze with a faint discomfort.*
-Perhaps someday though yes..

why u sending down a rabbithole
<:idek:694605001502228540>
:)
but yaaaa' idk what to do about most of that.

I could swap browsers, in general I feel safe with Ublock Origin and another addon that automatically denies all Cookies that it can
what safe browsers are even out there now... I would assume it has to be a forl of Firefox before their policy changes, but don't know which those would be from the top of my head
I'm just like "they gonna know shit about me anyways, not worth the effort"
on my phone I also really enjoy using Firefox, cause I can syncronize the contents of my pages between devices, and in general has all the features thar I want + am used to the layout already

Is from this? XD
I don't think it's the artstyle
xD
but possible
R�gebben n�ztem, hogy ez tetszene, de azt�n m�st vettem helyette

I meant it was inspired by this
uuuh
Szeretn�nk valamikor egy Feh�rv�ri s�t�get�st most m�jusban? Benc�nek (ha minden igaz) az utols� kett� h�tv�ge m�k�dne.
oh wait u mean as fanart
ye I realized xD
kedd, szerda, cs�t�rt�k
All are possible candidates
Akkor legyen cs�t�rt�k ha mindenki m�snak is m�k�dik. I'll set the session up online this time.
hmm
J� lenne, de 27. k�rny�k�n l�v� h�tv�g�n nem tudn�k menni val�sz�n�leg
No irl option this time?
We could if everyone is up for it
<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
Cs�t�rt�k j� lehet.
irl is m�k�dik, csak akkor �gy k�sz�l�k
Alrighty akkor
<@&1307302474109161505> ki lenne benne egy cs�t�rt�ki irl session-ben? Valszeg n�lam tartan�nk, egy mainly exploration based session lenne ahol megpr�b�ljuk a Verem kalandot lez�rni.
Nekem a m�jus m�sodik fele k�lt�zk�d�ssel �s azzal kapcsolatos foglalkoz�sokkal fog telni, nem biztos hogy tudn�k menni
Depends on how long i'm held captive for help-to-pack-for-moving xd i'd prefer online, that i should be able to arrive back to

Okay so my first was this

But
I did achieve this after a bit xD

I tried my fake shitty russian accent and I got

Eey xD
Guess I'm dutch now
Now Imma try reading it as I would if I didn't learn a lick of english
XD
It can't comprehend it XD
For me it gave 100% Hungarian on it xD
Even though I sometimes fuck up and read it vaguely as I actually should
Hogy k�sz�ljek, kik j�nn�nek?

*Hon, hon, hon*
so I took a gamble recently (not actual gambling dw xD)
and it paid of sooooo well
I need to pay healthcare fee
but it can be eliminated with the EU health insurance card that you can get for free for paying the health insurance in Hungary

because Hungary sucks I didn't get this card done by the payment deadline (which is like mid april, even though I requested the card in December in Hungary), meaning I get a 5euro late payment fee atop that

now that I have the EU card, I submitted it, and thank god Finland waved the fee+latepayment fee for this semester too, not just for the next one
:DDD

WAAAAAAAAAAAT
they gonna refund my previous semesters too

Lil meetup would be nice still
Morrowind is probably next. Perhaps a remake of arena, as a spin-off. Redguard? Perhaps. Anything to not have to make a new game.
I want to see them try to convert daggerfall to 3d.

Yea, he ain't sticking around for long as the ketamine he has been abusing has completely eaten away at his brain
Have you heard him try to talk recently?
There is a monster in the forest and it speaks with a thousand voices. It will answer any question you pose it, it will offer insight to any idea. It will help you, it will thank you, it will never bid you leave. It will even tell you of the darkest arts, if you know precisely how to ask.

It feels no joy and no sorrow, it knows no right and no wrong. It knows not truth from lie, though it speaks them all the same.

It offers it's services to any passerby, and many will tell you they find great value in its conversation. "You simply must visit the monster.", "I always just ask the monster."

There are those who know these forests well; they will tell you that freely offered doesn't mean it has no price.

For when the next traveller passes by, the monster speaks with a thousand and one voices; and when you dream you see the monster; the monster wears your face.

Yes thank you
> I followed a general rule of "one for enemies, one for friends, and one for fun." I ended up with a fire mage that could pump out good AOE damage, heal my allies, and have some utility spells that saved the party in a few instances.
never heard this "one for enemies, one for friends, and one for fun" but definitely gonna go for that if I'll play a caster
Witches know the ultimate tactic: if I don't know what I'm casting, you won't know how to react

welcome to the Divine spell list (aka a part of my Leshy Animist's backstory):
```
Masterful Sun Drinker (aka Sunny) has been an agent of the Dame of Otherside since he knew of himself, which to be frank is only a couple hundred years, quite young for a leshy who can live forever. However young, Sunny's mission was an important one. A new magical seed destined to make this offputing material world more homey to the likes of him. During his guardship he became a prominent force in the Deaththorn Grove, where he grew together with the seed's potential. Masterful Sun Drinker befriended the local animals and plants, as well as the local spirits of nature who he frequently called on in the few times the forest has been disturbed by outsiders.
While he never left the grove, due to both being content with the place and as it was his duty to guard it, he still learned a lot of the outside world. Most of his knowledge comes from a druid named Uirch who frequented the area quite a lot for the past twenty or so years. Another source of knowledge was travellers who for some reason still choose to wander through the threateningly named region. Sunny always welcomed them in his lands and was happy to share the bounties of the grove with them, like a true fey would. Up until one of them broke the delicate codes of hospitality and thus rightfully had to be put down or at least punished. Of course Sunny made sure they only suffered a fair and understandable ammount for their trespassing, someone doing wildly inappropiate things like spit on the forest floor and kill a bug by drowning it would suffer from unquenchable thirst that slowly killed them through dehydration no matter how much they drank. While smaller, yet still serious offenses like carving markings into trees and such would be met with weeks of stolen ambition and constant misfortune on a level that could easily end someone's carrier.
However this all changed when a trio of Kindle, a group known for their perverted love of dead trees, named Guph, Surkh, and Murk approached the grove. At first they were welcomed by Masterful Sun Drinker like any other, although with an air of suspicion, Sunny thinking they came to take trees to make more of their abominations, the woodmade leafpiles. The Kindle hid their true intentions well until they found the clearing where the seed has been kept, and once they did, they lashed out, quick and precise. The first mage quickly learned not to underestimate a leshy as he tried to fly accross the small river flowing in a circle around the clearing, only to be pulled down into the waters by vines and suffocate below the waves. The second mage put up a good fight, enough in fact to let the third escape with the seed just as he gave in to the ghoulish cravings for raw flesh and rushed into a cloud of choking poison to try and eat his drowned comrade, but died of the poison before he could help himself.```

WE HAVE FOUND A USE FOR CRYPTO
it's avoiding cross country transaction fees xD but I guess it is a use

basically:
Stripe (a big payment provider, akalike Simple Pay or PayPal) made a crypto that they back 1-to-1 by USD, and since crypto doesn't have huge payment fees on cross continental payments like most bank transfers do, they can use that to let a business take cross country payments or pay remote employees without needing to eat several layers of fees and such

pretty smart
also it's all under-the-hood, you see never see the crypto itself, it just makes the there and back transfer as you get the money around and since it is stable 1-to-1 usd it is basically lossless

"As you approach the area, SpringBog at first appears to be a collection of ramshackle wooden stilt houses floating on the water, but as you get closer, you see wooden pathways, tufts of swamp grass, and stunted cypress trees. The remarkably flat island stretches for quite a distance with areas of standing water dotting the surface, some large enough to require a boat to cross. There doesn�t seem to be a village center of any sort, rather, the buildings have been constructed to take advantage of any solid land. Small, scaly, dinosaur-like humanoids scurry busily back and forth, though many stop to stare as you near. You see one obvious landing spot�some ramshackle docks near where most of the activity lies�but not too far around the curve of the island, you spot a small beach away from curious eyes."

They were Merrows

Oh
Oh well
My memory is shit
But you did fight a lot of Sahuagin. Even on the ship.
Nah makes sense, the boss on the ship was a Sahuagin. But you finished the sahuagin team and triggered the merrow encounter after
But like 12 seconds after the bossfight that brought the party to the edge xD

Self-cleaning
No need to pee or wash their clothes

Just wanted to point it out bc its so funny
https://tenor.com/view/whothefuckstartsaconversation-gif-22983824
I mean I only have armor
As far as I know
And like... one can't wear the same clothing after they washed them? XD
Or like... They do it off screen when they have the time?
I don't remember having actual clothes because I am a fish person
Maka basically constantly smells like fresh fish, so does Wrrstkalk
xD
That's what I think of
Ofc
imagine rp-ing the pee break in Chains
xDDD
I assume they are like us just we don't mention them changing clothes every day and using the "bathroom"

I need to settle a really important argument
does sushi need to have fish/animal product in it?
no

kappa maki is literally that
Nop, not at all
<:point:951578243415302235>
tyvm
someone calling himself a weeb called this an abomination lulz

That's just a wannabe weeb
well idk how westernised it is
yeah
xD
but kappa maki literally means cucumber roll
Nay
There's many kinds of veggie roll makis too
They don't have to have meat in it
There are people who don't even like it with meat in it
He really couldn't google it or what xDDD
Mom also tought that sushi means raw fish.
For loooong time
Until I bought sashimi once and brought it home as a snack. She was bewildered
Nice xD
I ate it alone tho. Which was sad xD
sushi by definition means sour rice
Hungarian older peeps often don't like these "strange Asian foods"
Ap�m is mindig azt mondja ink�bb enne t�r�scsusz�t xd

I'm sorry to ruin it but the only thing I think of whenever I see this is Horizon Zero Dawn
xDDD
I knooow T-T xD
Originally i wanted Typhoon but that's not really a girly name
First thing we said when she dropped the name
Ciklon
Nahh
Not feelin that one
Breeze
A girly name is whatever you make up XD
There are names literally made of two letters XD
Zephyr could be cool :D
That's cute but too basic/overused/popular
I don't think I ever heard anyone having that
yea same xd
Zephyr is boyish for me xDDD but it really is a cool name
But I guess we move in different circles
Zephyra
xDDDDD
That's good but it's no longer a... how do i say it, i wanted a "thing" name, not a name name, if you know what i mean xD
Khazri
Yeah but for me, names sounds in a way, they kindof have a sound to me that tells me if i can imagine it on a boy, a girl, or something neutral
N'aschi (m�g aposztr�f is van benne XD)
And i wanted something english xD
Alize
XD
I got the perfect one for you
*East Asian Monsoon*

These were the original names i was thinking of
Monsoon
Omg
Just saying
Monsoon is cute
There's a guy in a game, who's codename is monsoon
XD
Nice xD
I'm trying the name out atm
Saying it out loud
It's cute, but it's still a little... hmmm
*Clipper* XD
That is cool but it sounds like you'd be about to unload a gun on someone
Clipper is goblin/kobold name to me xDDD
It's a name for a regional wind in our world
It could be xD but it sounds goblinish as a name xDDD
Cers sounds cool too
*Halny*
Mistral is van
az is egy boss a MGRR-ban
Kona
Well that was neat. Horizon it is
Yep xD
I think i'll stay with Horizon
*But the Zero Dawn is surely to follow*
*I've calculated with the risks of that*

I got work this Monday
So imma arrive at the halfway mark
But I will try to ask to be let go sooner if possible
It would be nice, de nem tudom mikor �rek haza
Am occupied tomorrow
Vas�rnap perhaps?
Az jobb lenne
Am also occupied sunday
xD
XD i'm sorry, most indulnak be a k�lt�z�si folyamatok �s most minden szabadid�m ezzel megy el :'D
I'll be checking the other place sunday to see if the bedroom could fit a loft bed
It's alright dw <:UwU:959931778905276456>
Loft bed eyo? OwO
eyyy those are cool
Yes yes UwU my childhood dream would come true if it eould fit :3
Then let's hope :3
I had one all my childhood, please discuss with me I an give important pointers
but also, I did eventually prefer a double bed for myself instead of the loft
(the cat can and will get up the loft bed btw)
We had - while it was not a loft bed - a bunk bed when we were kids, so it's exactly new to me
Mintha az eddigi �gy�ra nem m�szott volna fel mindig XD
Az szerintem nem zavarja tov�bbra sem
Oh this one is not single sized :3
It's a matress-size-140x200cm loft bed
*queen sized loft bed*
DAMN
that actually counters most negatives of loftbeds automatically I think
Yep, i'd have plenty of room underneath
Okay maybe not that big but ye xD
Yeah xD
It's not double but not single either
But it could fit 2 people
cus a loftbed needs to be **heavy** to be stable and a large one like that is most definitely heavy
Yeeaah, but i'd also likely put a wardrobe under it, or something for extra support
Depends on the people but ye xD
*YEAHH*
Gonna be a little nook under it?
Cozy???
Ahhh yess it's so cozy
I'd make a reading nook under it
Probably
Basically it's whole area underneath is free for me to fill
It's recommended to screw the legs to the walls for extra support cuz it's literally standing on 4 legs xD
Ajajj xdd
> It's recommended to screw the legs to the walls
YES
BUT it looks super fucking stable in ikea
Feelt super stable
*As it was screwed into the wall*
But my dream knows no boundaries
I want a loft bed book nook
And if it fits then oh boy
You guys not gonna see me
XDDD
*And i can still put bookshelves or high cabinets or a wardrobe under it for extra support*
I have my hopes high but it's probably not gonna fit though :(
It's 215cm tall
It'll probably be too close to the ceiling
:(((
Ah
Damn
Some hight could be taken off it with some adjustments to the legs, no?
It could, but then it might be too low under it

<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
I see
It'd just get cozier <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
***Fair enough***
xD
Who needs to be able to stand up straight, when you have a cozy book nook
*bean bag lil shelf moment*
*My thoughts exactly*
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
I was thinking of bean bags a lot :3
Time for some bean bags then :3
On my to do list already :3
*To be fair most people can't fit underneath their beds* XD
*I can fit **in** mine like one would fit in a coffin*

spamelem itten, nagyon rawr~

Okay so, i asked my brother to measure the bedroom's ceiling height
I need yall's opinion

You think this would be alright?
(Kurv�ra ar�nytalan a rajz �s perspektivikusan helytelen xD de az ar�nyok helyesek)
Kb. 72 cm maradna a matract�l a plafonig
Yeah kb
So fel�lni val�sz�n�leg fel tudn�l, de el�g k�zel lenne a plafon a fejedhez
Fel�l is �s alul is el�g kev�s hely lenne rendesen kiegyenesedni
Meg ha m�g mondjuk ny�jt�zkodni szeretn�l felfel� XD
Nekem el�g klausztrof�bnak t�nik
I like small nookish places
Az als� r�sz nem arra van hogy �lljanak alatta
Az �gyon meg aludni fogok xD
H�t, ha nem zavar hogy annyira k�zel van a plafon
Gondolom annyira nem ugran�l meg m�g ha r�m�lmod is lenne
I know I myself wouldn't want this because on days when I get sick and tired and would have nausea and maybe could throw up any moment, I would'nt want to climb up and down
I wouldn't have the energy, nor would I be able to get down in time
Absolutely fair
De szerencs�re nem vagyok az a nagyon mozgol�d� fajta, �s h�ny�sos bajaim sincsenek gyakran (1 occasion in many years) (lekopogom)
But I guess even on those days you'd still have the couch to lie on
Yep
A pretty big couch too
I think you should go for it
De akkor az a 72 cm nem a vil�g v�ge, yeah? N�zegettem emeletes �gyakat, azoknak is ilyen 70 cm k�r�l van a k�t fekv�hely k�zti t�vols�g
Now this is not a bunk bed, of course, de att�l meg nem v�szes, yeah?
Nah
Az h�lyes�g
M�mint a bunk bedn�l xD
Ha t�ged nem zavar, hogy majdnem karcolja a fejed b�bja
(Kurv�a eln�ztem xD oops)
(Am dumb)
De am�gy nem t�nik v�szesnek �nszerintem
Engem annyira nem zavarna
Nem nagyon szoktam �cs�r�gni az �gyamon
Ha olvasok is fekszek rajta
Akkor mi�rt minket k�rdezel? XD If you don't mind then who are we to stop you
Mert att�l m�g kiv�ncsi vagyok a v�lemeny�itekre
XD
Mert lehet az �n fejemben valid
Az a 72 cm
De lehet ti m�shogy l�tj�tok
*I wouldn't even fit into either part of it properly, if I take an upright position* XD
*Yeeaaah* xDDD
Megmutattam anyunak is a sketchet
� az�rt annyira nem tartja j� �tletnek xD "nem fogsz tudni ott fent elf�rni, fel�lni, mi van ha m�r nem leszel egyed�l?" XDDD
I didn't want to say i'm not gonna do shit on that bed xD
Azt mondta j�l gondoljam meg, aludjak r� xDDD
||*That's not a bed that can support exercise of any kind* xD *I'm also not planning to do much of that kind of exercise either, if i end up doing any in the first place*||
Yeah, but aside from that, if you just have an ace partner too, they can be taller than you, and they might not be able to fit in there, and also might not like the claustrophobe feeling of having to take the stalking ghoulie posture to avoid the ceiling XD
XDDDD
That's fair xDDD
But really, do i have to plan around a partner that doesn't even exist (yet)?
No
just saying
Yeah yeah
Ha �gy ad�dna valamikor, majd megoldj�tok
Ink�bb egy olyan k�lt�i k�rd�s volt xD
They might exist. You justs didn't find them yet
Addig elviteted ezt az �gyat max �s kicser�led egy sim�ra, azt cs�
Yeah
I think it's be a future's problem once i have a partner
M�g az�rt �tgondolom, de a sz�vem nagyon a loft bed fel� h�z
Fair thinking.
Ja, eddig amit mondt�l, hogy semelyik h�tul�t�je nem zavarna �s mindig szerett�l volna ilyet, mi�rt ne ez legyen
Yeah
Thank yall for the help
Tho m�g megv�rom m�sok mit mondanak
M�g kiv�ncsi vagyok m�sok v�lem�ny�re is

btw <@282869456664002581>, I'll likely be 20-30 mins late to the session, my little brother cancelled his barber appointment and I'm going in his place, which just so happens to collide with the start, and I get back by bus, thus the delay. I can likely listen in all the same, so there should be no real need to wait for things, I hope <:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>

The Eye
kohl
This almond-shaped pool is rimmed with dark mud, almost like a kohl-lined eye. The water is in constant motion as bubbles break the surface, giving the entire area a pleasant, burbling soundtrack. It would, perhaps, be a peaceful sight if not for the fact that the water has turned a deep and disturb- ing shade of red

I'm sorry but: bubble head lul
(I was forced to do this)
Btw are these OCs lately or from something I simply don't know about?
Daniel's OC
The white haired guy i draw so often nowadays that's not Kuwe'i is my OC
This is Chia
The guy with the green eyes
This menace
Yea, a mindsmith type boyo
Mindsmith?
O.O
What's that?
Am dum
Mindsmiths make weapons/shields from thin air and fight with that often even changing them mid combat to fit the situation
I don't remember if it's magic or smth else all of the sudden
Oh okay yep that's him xD
The last fightscene i wrote, he changed his weapons 7 times
Sounds a lot but who am I to judge
He had to, he kept throwing them into the enemies flesh and using them in unintentional ways xDD
And of course because other stuff was needed
*He'd definitely be a fighter or a barbarian in dnd*
*Or maybe even a paladin*
Hmmmm, I would've went with rogue from this description
His fav weapon is a claymore
But he can wield anything
And i mean ***anything***
Tawern brawler would also fit him
Alright fair fighter it is
Oh boy i wanna make him into dnd now xDD
He is a lesser power so Exemplar would fit better
He's a lesser god about-to-disappear xD (no followers, barely any power, etc.)
Ye but if i wanted to make him into a playable character... xD
exemplar is playable. They are a "demigod" that hold a shard of divinity in themselves
-# But they are pf2e
Yeah
-# mindsmith is also pf2e sry :s
But its description fits him perfectly tho
In means of... class?
Is it a class,
?
An archetype
So
Sort of a class
Subclass? XDDD
Yea let's say that xD
So like instead of taking the feats of the main class u choose
U can take dedication feats
So like, multiclassing of sorts xd
Mindsmith is not a class but you can multiclass into it
So you could be a fighter mindsmith
Ah okay i see
Yeah
That fits
And if it fits, i'd sit, but he's fictional :(


||i'd sit on quite a few white-haired guys||
||-# *Him included*||
Go and watch ep.7.
I have a fun theory for you after

WotC just dropped the Psion class unearthed arcana
It's an in based full caster who has an insanely limited spell list but an additional pool of Psionic abilities to choose from (can be built into kind of a gish)

https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/ua/the-psion/mXCPWlh2yy5tBKqP/UA2025-ThePsion.pdf
(it kind of seems like WotC is treating it as a 4th spellcasting tradition: Arcane, Primal, Divine, Psionic)
They are actually experimentint with new classes? Whaaaa
There is no cooking sheets ;-;
I have to hop out to the shop might be like 10ish mins late

hey, I have a probably very silly question 

so I have finally made myself an instagram, but I have not posted anything yet, because of the entire AI scraping thing happening.

don't get me wrong, I'm not scared they'll steal my style, I don't yet have a definite style and my art is not top-notch or anything like that, it's just... the principle of the thing

so... yes, I could download Nightshade and poison all of my images, but that takes a lot of time and resources, and honestly, I'm just tempted to post my stuff as-is, but I feel awfully guilty about the thought alone, because it'd just aid the scrapers anyway.

could anybody weigh in, please?
I'd say watermark and believe in EU legislation catching up with image stuff like that
or alternatively, don't use instagr*m and use a more protected site that properly guards against web scrapers
I think <@242727379447971840> knows one/some

its just always a tricky question
like
do we determine it by nature or social norm?
like female or woman
ok� nem tudom, hogy ilyen kor�n �n ebbe bele akarok-e kezdeni xd
de
csak gondoltam le�rom ami eszembe jut xd
Well, society puts pressure on being "in line" for sure
how dare you talk about your thoughts
by nature I'd say things would be ***much more fluid*** both in roles and expectations
just then religion happened
and fucked everything up
xD
But that contains everything, from the way that you look, to the way that you carry yourself, to what you've achieved
ye
BOXING
Are you upholding your societal duties like paying bills and taxes on time
lets put everything in a box
religion is also part of making a society
the church is
yeah that
Yeah, but it takes a backseat nowadays
*it takes backseat in europe
america is so damn church driven still
the world is huge now
Because back then the church usually had the same power as the governing force
it just gets pushed back
You paid taxes to it too
it however sow such social seeds, our life is still governed by some of it
In the background, but that's more of a flavor to it all
The good christian american who parttakes in the rat race
I think if the church wasn't so powerful in america it would have a much weaker republic party and an actually democratic democrat party
Faith is only secondary to the always hungry for outside recources nation. It's easier to sell it if you are good christians of your nation loved by god, so taking things from others, denying aid from "outsiders" in need, who are "not up to standards", who are not sharing the same ways as you
But that's also the extreme
Sure there are people who actually believe in their faith
But the faith is exploited, just like anything
It's sold
But to be fair it was used like this a lot way back in the day too
*Way back in the day* and it never really stopped
yea church exists because faith is a very easy way to control masses
Yeah
Anyway, XD
anyways, what is important is that you are fake
Pitting people from the same group against eachother is the same as it ever was
*Who are the more x of x group?*
*Who are the superior*
uhm
I am, duh
But at least this is just a meme, at least it is to me, and I think it was meant to be considering the poster's name
yes, that is 100% meme/satire
Damn. Good job!

While Abadar might not care about the exploitation of workers, clients, or anyone else so long as the economy thrives, he did care enough to take a rather personal approach to justice: when his own brother, Llod, stole from his vault, Abadar didn�t simply kill him, he erased his brother and his memory from existence.
He can go stand next to Reverse Flash and Dr. Doom for pettiest fictional characters
Abadar, Master of the First Vault
"Abadar is worshipped as the god of cities, law, merchants, and wealth."
**Edicts** bring civilization to the frontiers, earn wealth through hard work and trade, follow the rule of law
**Anathema** engage in banditry or piracy, steal, undermine a law-abiding court

Oh hogy online

B�r az online surely k�nyelmesebb
Tho fenntartom az irl lehet�s�g�t xD
Nah most szertintem nem. Hacsak nem tud Reg� helyet biztos�tani. Majd a k�vit kell irl tartanunk.
Only 2 sessions of Avernus remain and I'd like to have all of the "final" sessions of a layer irl.
That makes things easier
Viszont ma nem hiszem hogy k�nyelmes lenne r�szemr�l a webcam, nagy a felfordul�s and i don't wish to show all that, if yall don't mind :')
And more epic
Well yeah. Avernus finale might be the most epic session I held so far.
Minis could make it cooler but alas
maybe
nem tudom hogy anyu�k p�nteken elmennek e m�r
majd meg kell k�rdeznem
Sounds good to me
mintha m�sok nem l�ttak volna rendetlens�get ezel�tt xD
de okay
K�rd�ses hogy p�nteken tudn�k-e lenni. Ha igen akkor is csak online

Sphagnum moss, which carpets the ground in nearly any marshy location that doesn�t have a wooden walkway (i.e. an uninhabited area)
Sugarcane, which grows wild but is also cultivated by the mirescales, mostly on the eastern side of the island
Water drawn from the Eye or from one of its offshoots
so: Mondu is just Piss juice of an ancient, sealed civilization

I made my first Foundry Module, would you guys be up to playtesting it?

It is based on this reddit post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1230ox7/house_rule_alternative_to_secret_rolls_the/>

In short, whenever you roll a blind roll, it shows you 4 possible outcomes and one of them is the true one, this way you still see outcomes when you roll a bunch of secret checks looking like this:
Na

there's huge ass long series that explain genuinely nothing xD

volume 1 might be like "Sons Of Horus" and then the sequel which continues the story is called "Reflection Cracked"
but you wouldn't know that cuz it says that nowhere
this reminds to this (idk where I heard it): "The amount you can speak without conveying any information is truly a unique lifeskill of yours."

Also that part. The party has managed to convince Bran to accept ressurection. The issue is that Bran is connected to the world by his anger. If Loveless dies Bran passes to the afterlife before he would have the chance to be ressurected, so the party is trying to keep that on the backburner for now.

<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
btw <@875753704685436938>, is ur crossbow (I believe that's ur ranged weapon) Magical already?
shed deals dmg with psionic knives
psi blades
bold of you to assume
I... what the steady aim for then
<:point:951578243415302235>
steadily aiming the psionic throwing knives
xD
https://tenor.com/view/bird-birds-mynah-capcut-zoom-gif-23327639
Steady aim can be used on any attack with any weapon I think
Melee or ranged
my msg prior to Tacti writing that was

I was thinking of picking up `Elemental Weapon`
> A nonmagical weapon you touch becomes a magic weapon. Choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. For the duration, the weapon has a +1 bonus to attack rolls and deals an extra 1d4 damage of the chosen type when it hits.
for that purpose, in case u want it 

, btw, but now I'm not so sure, kek
Psi blades are magic so it wouldn't apply sadly.
But we do have 2 melee characters with blades
Am not gonna be late
I am going for damage
But I also have a magic weapon, but my greataxe is not magical, so when dealing with groups of enemies that +1 to attack rolls and +d4 damage would come in handy
Also I can hit 3x on a single turn per combat, and twice generally, so that's something
Am the record holder for both most 1s and most 20s xD

look at you extremist smh

> Bloom. You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
yea but that is not an "you isntantly make a fully grown plant from a seed"

Note to self: Get Weed Wacker a cleave trait weapon
Ye
Wait
Cleave as in?
That isn't 2 handed, preferably
As in the weapon mastery
Van olyan?
like Vex, Sap, etc
Dunnae
Majd megn�zem
Lehet nem lesz, de rem�nykedni szabad
Well, it seems there are only 2 cleave type weapons, and both are heavy and two-handed
Makes sense
Yeah
Guess I'll get the crowd while she singles out the main problem
Ideally
*Flashback to crocodile fighting*
I also realized that I do need to throw another attack roll for the second creature after I successfully hit the first one
I dunno how I skimmed over that before
https://youtu.be/6PCkeeA_hW0?si=UEsM-Ti5Cm11loVW
WeedWacker is built to be 40% tanky, 40% buffer, 20% dmg
Yes.
*She can solo the boss*
Noticed that
there is like
one boss she might be able to solo in the future if she gets proper lucky rolls
*See, I knew she could do it*
I think papa could be a better melee as we progress
I can't wait for the time when I can crit again on 19 and my movement that doesn't provoke opportunity attacks becomes relevant

Yes yes :3
They usually still avoid bigger cats. Natural response. But this lil menace is inviting a cat 10 times his size like "hey uncle come and play, I'm bored"
i guess nyugis k�rnyezetben volt
Didn't we discern that gandalf is not a cat? So it doesn't apply
I don't even know if Lucifer will be fitting name xDDD

Guys
Who would like to play a little planescape?
els� sorban 3-4 j�t�kos k�ne, hogy test-runoljuk
cuz i wanna try dm again
I'm open to it after a few games finish
ez m�g csak chapter 1-2 lenne
once chapter 1 is finished, which is pretty short
its basically a sandbox, ott lehet hagyni
csak ha tetszik az embereknek akkor meg lenne id�m rendesen megcsin�lni az e�gszet
�s akkor �gy folytatn�nk, hogy m�r k�sz van az eg�sz
vagy m�r rendesen meg van �rva egy j� r�sze a j�t�knak
it pretty barebones so i intend to change and rewrite stuff
as one does with recent wotc campaigns
i also dont expect nothing too crazy
lehet azt�n csak �gy lefuttatom, kieg�sz�tve p�r r�szt ahogy vagy a k�nyvben
de el�bb, yeah, szeretn�m megn�zni, hogy menne e egy�ltal�n
so chapter 1-2

Damn, nice

we are in a kind of an argument and require a score of edginess on both of these pictures (ofc others can have their vote too)
first ine is a 2/10, second is a 4/10
Maybe the first is just a 1
damn
https://www.reddit.com/r/FUCKYOUINPARTICULAR/comments/1ldp604/f_u_tree
1st I'd say is standard viking style. I'd not call that edge, rather just cool.
2d Scores more on the edge scale for sure
but I guess we can give a few points for the 1st one too so let's call that a 2/10 and the second would be somewhere 4-5 / 10 if she didn't have that sideburns/ earlock part (whatever it's called), I just cant get myself over that XDD (not a fan gotta tell)
you have been called "Slim Shady" by the player when I showed him what u wrote xD
slim shady? are we stuck at Eminem? xd
yea he is a big music fangirl
The **man** is a fan**girl**, okay XD

(if it comes to music)

Yeah, the game will still be playable and purchasable on steam and the official site. What is happening now is just the continuation of the decision to remove the game from EGS, which started back in march. The only thing that changed is that now there is a deadline

Are we rolling init on that mention?

Hmm
I would assume Steam will get a court order about it too eventually but ofc idk how Korean courts work

Sometimes Trump is just, I don't even know what to say, mad genius of the worst kind?

The Big Beautiful Bill. You surely heard its name whispered while everyone was looking at the shouting match of the Elon breakup.

It's a bill that is just to slightly adjust government spending, perfectly standard. It cannot have new laws only adjustments to the budget. But in turn cannot be vetod. So it will 100% happen.

So uhm Trump was "I cannot outlaw stuff here, so I guess I gonna multiply it's budget by zero"
And turns out technically he can do that
And as a game tester, all respect to him. But only as a game tester
(this is also the thing that outlaws the regulations on ai, but idk how that is a "budget adjustment" ask someone smarter
Well, I suppose you do need to finance the people who regulate things

We'll see. If so, i hope the game will be picked back up by the original devs cus the current ones have no idea what they're doin xd
Specially the current head of the team
well, sadly when they stole the game the original company basically died
but there is hope if they get good payout from the lawsuit
We'll see
Btw would you call ~50% of population a good sample size?
yea that's quite good for research
Talkin about the game, around 12k people play the game still. (Degrading over time generally) but there was a poll where 6.1k voted

xDDDD
So ahm yeh xdd
The 5 precent are those who only wanted to see the results basically
hm
do you know how that looks like?
just a theory
but
possible they need to like hand over the game or earnings or smth and they just like "well it's dead sry lulz"

Wanna hear a funny story? Since Ubisoft said you (as a consumer) should give up on owning games. the visitations of the torrent sites have doubled. Not the redistribution sites, but the torrent pages.
I honestly can't with this guy
He is speaking so much nothing >.<
Got to half and received about 0 information
You do you
I mean they did talk about PS misrepresenting
I think that is important enough info :p
yeah thats the big part! Its not clarifying what PS missed but what this movement is actually about
the long video is for that
One of my main issues is that this marked part is something that might succeed and would fuck indie studios making f2p games that actually need a server. But I guess worthy sacrifice for the greater goal

A more generic problem, they are trying to backdate this, or how to say, they want this to effect already existing games 
# FUCK NO
to that, holy shit that would make so much crash and burn (if it was actually enforced, cus it could be made and not really enforced due to how much pain it would be to)

Also I'm missing one very big part here, but it might come up later, what's up with games as a service with no expiration date?
Wait he said he wants to backdate and then said he didn't now which?
What
these are horrible and none of them should be used XDDDDD
-# 10/10
https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1ljsong/i_need_pickup_lines
xD
XD
I like the gouda one
1' Indie studios would not be fucked over. Most f2p indie games that requires servers are based on p2p (peer to peer) or on downloadable servers that most of the time are free as well. If its neither of these too, then the only thing required for the dev after the end cycle of the games lives that they make these public or accessible for the community to operate. (for example: minecraft, older COD titles, jackbox games, the long drive, PEAK and so much more )

2' No it wouldn't require backdate, it was an early idea form the community and it was quickly made clear that would not happen. (we are not trying to revive a 20yr old games multiplayer mode, but funny thing most games of that era are STILL PLAYABLE TO THIS DAY)

3' No expiration date means if someone purchased a content, us "the consumer" should have access to that content even if the redistribution or support for that content ended (emphasis on support). (for example: Destiny2 first 2 dlc and original camping is unplayable. They where literary deleted form the game files and there is no way to access them. both of the dlc's and campaing cost around 120eu or more depending the edition you got.)

Today's market is not about the protection of the customers or giving them a worth while experience for they money. Its purely for maximizing profit. They dont care to make things even. This movement was made to give back the safety of buying a product and being able to use it for years or decades to come. It would require NOT just game studios, but many other to not force us into a state where they can just take things away because they feel like it or because they can get away with it. 
If you where to buy a Swith 2 today in the nearest shop or on the internet. You would not get a switch, just a license...
you can hold it, you can play with it, but you wont own it
and if we are keep rolling down on this hill and we don't do anything about it, we wont even own the keyboards that we use to type this
oh and funny thing if you use the wrong voltage charger it could mean that you tried to tamper with the switch in your hand and nintendo can shut it down anytime they wish
no buts or ifs
Damn

nem ker�lt ennyibe az els� aut�m

It sounds similar to what the EU ordered phone companies to do with phones. 5 years of updates after the last unit sold on the official website, and 7 years of making and selling spare parts. Oh and no new phones brought to the EU market can have glued in batteries, the consumer needs to be able to change it at any repair shop.
Companies don't want us to own anything at all.
Makes us more reliant on them

Such majesty from this little lion

it more and more feels like we need a pet pics channel xD
Perhaps xD
name suggestions?
``the-beauty-of-pets``? xD
``pet-posting-table``?
smth else?
The peeps are pointing at her

:D
Excellent question xd
I like to call her Tiga-Maffia
I don't think it's necessary but Pet-Posting sounds good
Another channel I'm on just has a "cute-aninals" chat xD
*yes written like that*
I was just about to ask aninals but okay xD
Fel�lem az is lehet. Akkor tal�n kev�sb� keverj�k �ssze a t�bbi posting nev� csatorn�val
The frequency of pet images flooding some of our channels has manifested a pet posting channel completely by itself!
What a weird turn of events huh?

Call it aninals then <:potatgandalf:1266340860585312338>

it's face looks like some face swapping software triggered on it accidentally xDDD

Hogy lett v�ge a sessionnek?
A faluban m�g int�zt�nk dolgokat: OnaOna k�pes Killhaul-t egy napig kint tartani a telep�l�sr�l egy var�zslattal, amihez szerezt�nk egy min�s�gi rubint
-# *Keelhaul
Megbesz�lt�k vele m�g, hogy k�l�n felkeresi az Ikolfokat, �s figyelmezteti �ket, hogy Fylkir a lesz�rmazottai v�r�t akarja felhaszn�lni valamire, �gyhogy aki teheti, keressen valami b�v�helyet
Megtudtuk, hogy a d�lnyugati sziget az megk�zel�thetetlen, be van r�n�zva
I remember that
Azt�n tov�bb haj�k�ztunk a Turntail Swamp fel�, k�zben meg r�nk cuppant egy �hes hidra
Azt pikk-pakk elrendezt�k
Ut�na partot �rt�nk az ottani vil�g�t�toronyn�l, ahol egy id�s ikolf h�zasp�r lakik. Elmondt�k melyik banya hogy n�z ki, egy-egy inf�t r�luk
A legmagasabb az nagyon fiatalosan n�z ki, a legalacsonyabban meg flaming� tollak vannak, a k�z�ps� meg a k�z�ps�, aki ha j�l eml�kszem meglep�en gyors
Eastport?
Igen
A mocs�rban �ri�s f�rgek vannak, wurm-ok
Oh
Cute
Ezeken k�v�l amikre m�g jelenleg eml�kszem, az hogy OnaOna sz�lni tud majd nek�nk, ha Keelhaul-�k megjelenn�nek Keyport-n�l, meg tan�tja RunAway-t a Locate Creature-re
A h�zasp�rral is besz�lgett�nk. A h�lgy, aki n�ma, az Fylkir egyik lesz�rmazottja
Kuwe'i telepatiks sz�lat hozott l�tre vele, amin kereszt�l RunAway is tudott k�rdez�sk�dni, meg ut�na setup-olta a h�zasp�r besz�lget�s�t is
*rokona (not direct descendant)
V�rrokon, az a l�nyeg
I'm sure I left some things out
Sz�val a vil�g�t� toronyn�l van mindenki?
Or where did we stop?
Igen, ott �jszak�zunk bent

*Mi�rt nem S&M foods, huh?* XD
Foglalva van akkor a hely?
Igen
Noice
------------------------------------
*That rainy night, the spirits wrath wrecked the shores of Eastguard, flooding the sand on the beach, waves high and mighty not allowing anyone to ride and dominate the waters of the manaki. It is common sense that noone would dare to challenege the spirits during such conditions. Yet one still tried...
Papa stood outside, feet sunken in the sand almost knee deep, facing the angry sea by himself, forcefully grasping the Marrow in his hand. He stood there, then turned and thrust forth with a firm form like confronting an invisible enemy. He advanced with heavy steps, his bare feet struggling against the muddy restraints of the sand. With his last step he faltered having to use the legendary spear to support himself from falling forward. He gritted his teeth and looked up, starting all over again.*
(Yes)
I guess this goes for Gandalf too
https://tenor.com/view/thecraft-nancy-witchcraft-lightning-gif-7968899
*Maka saw the old man leave the safety of the lighthouse's walls, and decided to follow him after a few moments' delay. She stopped in her tracks, observing the tiefling from farther, not letting her presence be known yet. Only after seeing Papa falter a little does she speak up.*
- I see you took what I said to heart, which I commend you for. Still, don't you think practicing with someone yields much greater success? Not to mention the ever so hungry-growing creatures, which can seemingly emerge from nowhere at any time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Az EastGuard-i vil�g�t�toronyban t�lt�tt �jszaka alatt, Papa kil�p az �p�letb�l, �s egy kis id�eltol�d�ssal Maka ut�na megy.*
*The tiefling turns and looks at the kiai with a pained and emberrassed look on his face, like someone who got caught redhanded. He steadies himself, despite his aching leg and the runny mud beneath his feet.* -I rather become a better version of myself then to fall as someone who was just talk but no action....I know will never become one of you..I... *He silenced, looked at Maka with ssd eyes then nod her to come closer as the rain poured on them more.*
(Papa meg fog halni mert nincs rajta sapka)
(SSD eyes XD)
- That's the spirit. *She replies to the first sentence, but her encouraging tone quickly shifts to something akin to confusion.*
- One of us? You are already one of us, unless you mean a warrior, in which case you can still take steps to become one, even if it's a... far cry from an early start. *She steps closer but also signs to Papa that keeping the long, iron pointed "stick" towards the sky in the middle of a storm is less than ideal.*
(Its a bone spear)
(I forgor. Never mind the iron part then, but still. Long thing held up in a storm)

-I have the spirits of old warriors aiding me in my cause, yet these past couple of days I have never felt weaker and more insignificant then in the past 20 years... *Its obvious that his leg hurts and its difficult for hin to stand upright, yet he pushes through.*
- I only had my own warrior's spirit to rely on for as long as it first sparked in my chest among my reserved kind, who usually only tend to our way of life. I felt the same way in those peaceful times. That's why I often went to spar with the Mant-i to keep myself sharp. But now **my** time has come to put all that training to good use. *She flicks her flaring red hair-fin in a motion that exudes pride.*
- And I'd be willing and happy to share what I've learned, so it could forge us even stronger... but first we need to take care of your leg somehow.
(*Amputation and a peg leg would be my solution*)
*Papa looks at his leg then back at the kiai warrior.* -I am aware that ones insecurities can easily poke through one's self by setting unmeetable expectations. However, I hope you understand why I chose to be this way.
-And I hope to believe that you know that I am very well capable of standing my ground, still.
- I am. I never said to any of you spirit callers, magicks users, that you are useless or a lost cause. In fact, I wouldn't be able to invoke any of the more potent spells, but I also simply understand that a melee weapon is usually best suited for the likes of me, and RunAway, who also heavily relies on their use. *She sounds casual all the way through.*
- We spent years perfecting our techniques of the martial arts, while you honed yours with magic.
(Well, the leg thing I left out on accident, but oh well. Unless)
(I edit a few things)
*Papa looks very uncomfortable all of a sudden and it seems the rain starts to get to him.* -I think I rather take some time somewhere more...dry...wouldnt you agree? Although I assume the rain does not bother you.

- It really doesn't. Feels good. But there's a tub of seawater waiting for me inside too, and I only left the lighthouse to *spy* on you anyway. *She speaks the word 'spy' jokingly.*
- And about your wounded leg, you've served your sentence, after which you've been accepted by most of the land dwellers. Keeping it in this state would serve no one's interests aside from our enemies. You can still feel some guilt about the past if you wish, but don't let it keep you from giving your new goals your all, deny yourself the opportunity to be the best you could be. *She extends her membraned hand towards Papa to help him inside.*
(alright, let's see what you guys are chattin')
*Papa listens and just accepts her hand after.*
(Guide me fish lady)
(without reading what is before I'm just like, are u guys marrying already?)

(*Ocean man, take me by the hand, take me to the land, if you understand*)

*She lets the raindrops dry up at their natural pace.*
- Either way, wouldn't hurt to be able to move around better, faster, and not suffer the pain in the process, now would it? *She lifts her hands to the side a little.*
- If you will be wielding that magnificent lance, your leg not giving out on you will be very important. Tactical retreats are the other major thing it could help with. Failing in either or both could mean the difference between life or death, if no one else can help you. Just remember those giant crocodiles. I know I will. *She shivers a bit.*

Can't make out anything

Ye
U have an option to open in browser
I personally never felt weird and not normal about my lack of r&s feelings towards other people. It was everyone else I found weird who tried to force me into relationships with others, or said the ,,You will eventually find the one" lines, stuff like that
Even when I told them I don't care, never did, probably never will
I remember when I was still in elementary, between 5th and 7th grade somewhere. I was hanging out with my usual friend group that was mostly made up of my girl classmates, one of their siblings, one boy who was one girl's boyfriend, who also had a younger brother. We were hanging out like this for a couple years, did the usual stupid shit with games like spin the bottle, but one day the girls were like, you two (me and the younger bro) look cute together (even though we were just friends, on my end at least. Dunno about him.) so get out there on the balcony with him and get together or we'll cut ourselves if you don't
This was after some nagging which escalated into this. I was young and they were my friends, so I relented because I didn't want them to hurt themselves, so I went out and held his hand. I don't remember the rest
I don't have to say, we didn't get to gather XD
And if I could go back in time with my more experienced mind, I would tell them to go ahead, do it if they are so adamant about it
But I won't go, and do anything
Or that one 17yo when I was 14yo, who made more than a few moves on me the whole afternoon we met
Anna had more rizz in teen years then i did for sure
And it was very much unwanted. Made me feel like I was kidnapped and needed to play into things until I could make my escape
I wouldn't have minden trading that with anyone else who actually wanted attention and advances from others
So they would leave me the fuck alone
Olyan bar�tok mellett kinek kell ellens�g xd
*but like azt a kurva*
�ltal�noss�gban v�ve, nem voltak rosszak, csak volt ez a p�r nagyon elbaszott h�lyes�g�k
*like emotional warfare yes*
Haven't seen them after the first summer of highschool
They, alongside my boy classmates used to be my on and off again bullies in the earlier elementary years. I was mostly chill with them on my end, but it was when we started being teenager's that we became friends. We had more fun times than these bad experiences, so all in all, it wasn't the worst
It's just that we were all stupid, inexperienced people, sometimes with that childhood malice that seemingly comes from nowhere, from instinct
Ye
It really took a toll on my early socialisation skills
I was an ugly duckling. Glasses, yee-yee ass clothes my mother dressed me in, that even I was disliking, one eye patched for my vision correction
Idk, after we moved to vp everyone just felt so distant and reserved and much meaner
Very frail looking
Welcome to a city
Well noone told me that to 8 year old me xd
I got constantly rejected by my classmates for my unusual closeness and naivity
They don't pick on you because they know you and dislike you, they pick on you because you look weak and an easy target
Oh ye
Thats where it all began xddd
Same for the naivity, and the kind and charitable nature I had
with being very timid
and mainly spending my time drawing instead of socializing, even during class I was drawing. My teachers did not like that XD
Those were the early years, and then puberty hit, and I could choose my own clothes
I lost my glasses on 2 separate occasions accidentally (still don't know how that happened), started ditching my violin classes to hang out instead
I was constantly making a fool of myself by speaking whats on my mind
Teen delinquent lite
I think thats why i am nore reserved as of late
I just dont wanna say anything
Bc knowing people and you guys nitpicking and critisizing is a common theme :))
Well, I'm sorry I'm jaded. Sometimes I hate it too
I wish I could just not feel apathy and feel the wonder in everything like I used to, when every day felt like an adventure
When I wasn't an asshole
But I also don't miss being thought of as a little pushover, and being alone
Yeah but like...eversince we know each other i dont feel like anyone ever wanted to do anything about that. Maybe im really that self-centered thinking im the one who actually manages to hold back and just stay quiet when needed
But dont always felt like people put in the same amount of effort
How would anyone know how many times someone else held back?
But that was when kevin and kriszta was here. When generally everyone was more...
Can't be seen, and we are not mind readers
Unstable xd
Yeah
***intuition***
But i get it
We are still here for each other when need be, even if we bicker a lot
But you know maybe i was always delucional
S�rl�d�s az term�szetes
Expected too much from others and myself without proper communication
Since i was like...if i can see it then probably other do and would notice in time
Nem mondan�m. Val�sz�n�leg csak megszoktad kiskorodn�l fogva, hogy neked kell hallgatnod, mert k�l�nben basztatnak
�s ahogy r�gebben mondtad, m�g a bar�ti baszogat�st is annak vetted
I mean the og group was very vicious
And i was the youngest...always
Even now in my family i still feel like a kid
Igen, �s az, egy�tt azzal, hogy a bickering tolerancia szinted alacsony, �s hogy visszah�z�dsz konfliktus el�l, az nagyon �sszegy�lt
Az szerintem majdnem hogy univerz�lis
Legal�bbis �n is �gy �rzem, legal�bbis amikor nagyimmal vagyok
El�g lekezel� tud lenni
Ooh ye
Nagyon
Yeah csak ez mostm�r �gy teljsen
Belef�radt�l
Kifont engem abb�l, hogy sz�ks�g�t �rezzem a szocializ�l�d�snak
Ye
Im a stuck up now
Csak morgol�dok meg idegeskedek
�s v�gyok n�ha a v�ltoz�sra de mindig csak vissza tart az hogy rohadtul nincs kedvem hozz� meg anxious leszek
Cuz i feel like i cant do anything on my own properly
And i just dont even know where to start xd
I think that victim mentality stuck around
Ye
Sometimes i feel like not everything is against me but mostly i just feel like im stuck in the middle
Like i fell in pit
*Me when bureaucracy*
Or like got surrounded by a crowd
Az sem seg�t, hogy k�zben otthon is kapod az �vet
De ott t�nyleg minden�rt
Ye
Meg most itt kint is basically de csak mert pr�b�lunk elindulni egy uton hogy legyen mel�
A lehet� legapr�bb dolgok�rt is, amiket minden nap �gyis elv�gzel rendesen, csak a saj�t temp�dban
pl. a kutya s�t�ltat�sa
De nagyon nehezen tudom �ssze szedni magam �s actually izgatottnak lenni az�rt hogy keressek valamit
This is amazing
I'm kinda having a similar situation nowadays, realizing stuff about myself, that i don't really feel sexual attraction, not even after a long friendship/relationship
I do feel strong romantic and physical attraction, but not sexual. I don't like the idea of sex, I don't want sex at all. I don't feel that "i wanna take this person to bed" thing. Sexual actions don't make me excited
For long i thought there was a problem with me, but... now i know it's just what it is
So yeah xd here, a little part of my recent thoughts
I'm also super sad i was unable to go to the pride :(
There'll be next year, probably
I hope so
Hindsight is 20/20. I think we all have a lot of baggage that we "could have done better" but not really.
Not in that time, not with the lack of experience, yes
You critisize people just as much as any of us. You just take it much worse compared to most of us.
We do try to take back around you cuz 90% of the time when we are like that to eachother we know the others are joking
But that's been a running thing from the very start. You told us back in school as well that you absolutely despised how Kevin and I joked with eachother.
Yeah, dodged again. Ch. (jk. We'll go next year)
>:(
Most of us had those moments of ''fuck this shit. I'm out'', just for different reasons
Yupp. We still have things to work on but we'll get there
Some of us went, some of us stayed
||Like avoid dodging the group <@875753704685436938> ||

Adios
*Papa sits down achingly slow, his rain-soaked body dripping all over the place, leaving a small puddle under his muddy feet soon enough. He looks over the spear, laying it in his lap, contemplating on the past.* -If the spirits are truly at peace with me and you, as my team whom are all natives to the isles forgive me...I think you might be right....I have struggled enough...I might be a time for a new chapter to begin...I just hope Im not too old for it to begin...
<@282869456664002581> <@463641084971712514> <@&1209957581569916999> 
*Later after arriving back to the saloon, Bran floats to Pyre's door and forces himself to knock on it.*
\- Can we talk?
- You are old, not dead, so it is **not too late**. *She sits down in front of him.*
- Granted, it will be rocky, but that we can deal with. *After a little pause she looks the soggy grandpa over and lifts her hands chest level, palms facing the man.*
- I could dry you off with some air, if you want.
*He smiles kindly at the offer.* -Please, dry away.
(I command: dry)
(Papa ends up as a desiccated mummy)
*She speaks the magic words to summon a breeze, and keeps repeating it until the cleric's dripping clothes dry. After that she reaches for her waterskin to hydrate her parched lips.*
- That was a mouthful. I'm not used to these that much.
*Papas hair is shagged.*
-Thank you. *Says Papa with a greatful nod and stands up.* -This spear might carry our success and I had enough time to see how much pride we ourselves carry within...It should not divide us over something that means to ensure the betterment of the people and the security of our goals...
https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/14nukq9/oops_sorry_wrong_house/
btw we are officially starting the last 3rd of the campaign XDDD

*She nods as a "you're welcome.", then gets to her feet.*
- Pride isn't a bad thing to have if one can back it up with their skill. So, when do you want to start your training?
<:pogdwarf1:1112327046325080155><:pogdwarf2:1112327307315650661>
-Understandable...However, if I may, I would like to ask you one thing Maka'ala.
(Ah fuck i watched too much GoT)
- What would that be? *She looks curious, but her tone is serious, as if bracing for the upcoming question before it catches her.*
(*Are you feeling lucky, punk?*)
(Ayyyooo(
-I understand more then anyone, eversince I have been carrying the strenght of dozens of great late warrior's spirits with me, that the soul of a true warrior is unwavering and hard. *He smiles softly, his face is kind and understanding.* -And I know that all of us can be unreasonable at times, specially for the ones who are sure of themselves like you are, Maka. Yet I would like ask you to, as much as all of us, as much as me and Kuwei have promised, do your best and take back of being so self-assertive?
-I don't wish to upset you with this.

<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
Can't have armor with it tho?
I might be tired or dumb but I don't really understand the armor part of the text xd
*Her head snaps to the side but her black eyes stay fixated on Papa. She makes it plain to see that she thinks it's a tall claim to say he understands more than anyone what it is like to be a warrior, from someone she considers as a magical medic who only flirts with the warrior life by proxy, with the aid of spirits.*
- As I see, I am as assertive as I need to be in these end times. If you want me to be more tolerable, I am afraid you'll have to wait until we bring peace to this region once more.
(I honestly dont really want to deal with her character)
basically
what that part says is

you use unarmored prof if you are unarmored
you used light armor prof if you are light armored
etc

this gives item bonus to AC, just like amors do, basically replacing what your armor would give to you with it's own item bonus
I see
Gud
(Ain't nobody forcing you)
(Oh should i just quit the campaign? XD)
(Nem ezt mondom)
the moderate version for 12 gp brings your ac from 22 to 26
aka -20% chance to get hit and -20% chance to get critted
also you could get a colar as well if you wished since this is a mutagen
and that would make it activate as a free action
as you roll the init, so even if you are slow you already have the ac
Yea
That is a gud idea
Also i know i cant have it but damn the shieldmarshal dedication is nice xD
Even the first one
(�s tal�n nem �jf�l el�tt p�r perccel k�ne)
(try to see the pure logically reasonable as Maka does, I'm sure she will listen if you bring up an actual logical reason for things and not just feel like lowering the power of the group on the cause of vibes; you are the wise one, approach the conversation about it from an angle that Maka understands well)
(I dont think im lowering the power of the group. The real property of the weapon is something that is cannot be used regularily, other then tha its a +1 spear)
(�n csak ez�rt nem �rtettem hogy m�r...de honestly i get it)
(It just doesnt feel good)
(I did mention that casters won't have much access to magic items in this campaign as most items, especially stronger ones, are martial oriented)
(as for the power of the spear, yea, the lockdown ability is strong, but it would only be used in extremely specific and special scenarios, so it's main persistent bonus is it's +1 (and without spoiling much, the other martial buffs it'll give over time)
(If Papa will lead, then she will follow. Just, you know, take care of the people around, NPCs as well)
(She stood up because Papa was unavailable, absent a lot)
(Also because she wants to become a leader of her people too, even if she starts seeing the futility in that since who needs a warrior in peace times)
(We can drop this rp. We'll figure out the rest on sessions)
(Nah i get it. Im just yearning for more justification since the other campaigns never went the way I wished or didnt really exaxtly got what I wanted)
(Its my own pettyness. Papa can sit back just leave it to the others. It would fit the charwcter and it would also give the opportunity to other to experience the game more)
(the thing is, it feels like you wanted Papa to kind of be a leader(ish), spiritual shepherd type, and then retreated out of most group bonding activities and any kind of shot calling)
(No, i see that papa is not a leader  i just let others speak more and that just took me out. Also the fact that kuwei never even considered what he had to say to him, convinced me that this character is not really working the way i inteded i guess. Since i wanted him to be the wise mentor but i just lost motivation for it since other characters pushed their agendes more)
(I mean a mentor helps other reach for their agendas, not overwrite them, and also, we were/are still at the start, the unruly kid never listens to the mentor at the start)
(Its whatever, im impatient thats all)

(But also he is giving councle to those he wishes to teach)
Boooo
(I want Maka to ask him to help with learning the spell that can keep a corpse intact for days. Forgot its name)
(Gentle repose)
*wait could I get training from the duchess loyalists?*
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
(I know prolly not so quick but I can dream okay xD)

- Just... a second. *His voice can be heard from within, the words sandwiched between dry, painful sounding coughs. After a bit of shuffling the coughing abruptly stops and the door opens. Pyre stands in the door with a faint smile, his newly acquired gunshot wound freshly bandaged it seems.*
- Of course. Come in.
*He steps aside, inviting Bran in. His room though neat, most surfaces are covered with a thin layer of ash.*
- Something's bothering you perhaps?
*His expression shifts to that of concern.*

yes it dooooooes, monke brain feels safe if not on ground
But ground makes monke back happy. How math so?
some recent general good news from the world:
- Brasil had a drop of 34% in deforestation just in the past year
- MIT is being very close to developing an autonomous caregiver robot that can replace general caregivers for the elderly (which would be a major issue in the future due to the population drop we are experiencing world wide)
- Most endangered animal species (especially mammals) have been on the rise due to our overall improvements in conservation efforts
- June's UN Ocean Conference has created a new agreement called "BBNJ" treaty. "The treaty for biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction", the first treaty that covers the high sea, basically the part of the sea not in any country's region. 50 nations are already on board just from the first introduction of it, and from 60 the treaty will step into effect.
- On the same conference a treaty has been signed to globally reduce plastic production, the first global treaty that targets the creation of plastic, not just it's recycling and end-of-life handling (96 countries signed it).
- The UK announced a ban on bottom trawling (dragging a new through the bottom of the ocean), which was a highly disruptive industry in the region.
- France banned "fast fashion" advertising and apply huge taxes to companies engaging in fast fashion.
- France had successfully reestablished a living ecosystem in the Seine (the river flowing across Paris) which only sustained a mere 3 fish species in total just a decade or so ago.
- China had it's first year without a carbon emission rise thanks to employment of greener technologies in it's energy sectors, actually they fell 1.6% in the first quarter of this year.
- A 19 year old invented a new way to create anti viral drugs, which will hugely simplify their production, making it more radily available to fight huge virus waves like covid was. Reducing it's manufacturing cost from 75usd/gram to 12.5usd/gram, and is produced from agricultural waste.
-# I ran out of space to fit all the good news in one message
- A new paper based circuit-board material has been developed which will massively reduce electrical waste if adopted by the industry.
- The past 12 years the UK has managed to reforest many of it's originally forested areas that were destroyed for sheep herding, many native bird species have been thriving in these newly replanted "ancient forests" which will be able to self sustain themselves as they are planted in the areas where they lived originally. All this has been done by supporting local farmers to maintain woodland areas, making sure they are not driven out from their lifestyles.
The campaign will probably start migrating over to mostly online. Jelen helyzetben nem igaz�n megoldhat� az irl j�t�k de nincs gond vele.

*Papa hands the spear to Maka.* -Just please try not to turn it on the team too much. There is already enough pressure from all sides and it wouldnt be beneficial for people to get in their heads when they are already trialed from other sources.
-You know what Im try to say.
Hm
I need to say at this point that we may need to rethink the players for the campaign if things will continue like this.
If I put the campaign on hold for much longer (knowing myself) I'll drop it completely, and I'd prefer avoiding that fate for chains.
Fair
I can back out
Vannak szabad napjaim de �ltal�ban m�sik session van rajta so ye xd
Beoszt�s kinda sucks unfortunately
*She takes the spear with a surprised look on her features, but nods.*
- I suppose I have been more on edge these past days, and it culminated in the conversations with Kuwe'i and you. I want us to work together smoothly without arguing all the time... so fine. If that's what it takes to get things done. Not the first time I am called overeager or similar. *She sighs a bit and looks the weapon over, slides one of her hands on it, then grabs it, weighs it and finally, rests it against one of her shoulders as it stands tall.*
- A party's chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Seeing as I already own a magically imbued weapon, and how I made quick work of that hydra back there en route here, I believe RunAway could do with something of this nature more than I. Her arsenal is quite lacking. *She looks up to where the rest of the people are currently winding down.*
- I appreciate the gesture, still.
(*Immediately turns the **spear** on the team* XD)
*Papa nods.* -Thank you for understanding my point. Each of our ambitions consquentially will result in some friction between us.
- But we still have the same end goal.
(time for Maka to change shape back to Fylkir; I mean, nobody in the party seen Maka and Fylkir in the same room :D)
- I suppose that's it for your martial training. Or are you still interested in that?
*Visszaj�nnek, Papa �tadja Mak�nak a l�ndzs�t, majd � k�s�bb odal�p vele RunAway-hez, �s �tapsszolja neki, hogy kapja el, amikor m�r mag�ra vonta a figyelm�t.*

- Alright then. We'll get you sorted, but we won't start in here, and not outside in this weather either, so I was thinking, while we wait, there's something I could use your help with, as a man of holy spiritual powers. You see, we kia'i have a few innate magical abilities, and I haven't been able to properly learn one of them... Okay, that's a stretch. Haven't really cared or tried before. I'm much more for training. It is called Gentle Repost... Repose. That. *Her Common slips for a second, ending the misspelling with an airy voice.*

*Bran floats in after he's let in. His guns seem even cleaner than usual, he seemengly buffed out even small scuffmarks from them.*
\- I just wanted to ask if you. Hm.
*He shakes his head trying to fight his feelings.*
\- Do you think junior is a lost cause? Is he too far gone in the web of lies that he was told?
*Pyre closes the door as the other floats in while he listens.*
\- I.. do not know unfortunately. He seems to be a good kid with a good heart.
*He shrugs a bit as he walks to his bed, putting aside the healing kit he was using and sits down.*
\- He honestly made me consider whether we are doing the right thing. Whether she is, despite her flaws and sins, truly is as stable and great of a leader as Junior believes, and that she's really this needed for the wellbeing of the city. I would.. like to hear her side of the story but I fear that is not possible anymore... 
*He sighs.*
-\I do need to know a lot more on the politics of Alkenstar, he was right about that one for sure. And I think with the right evidence presented and the hope for a new stable leader he could see eye-to-eye with us. He's not fiercely loyal to Loveless, he's loyal to the city, and he truly believes that Loveless is the city's greatest chance at surviving a supposedly coming war.
*He gazes at Bran searching his expression whether that made sense to him or not.*
\- So I would say, no, not yet.

*Bran's chest seems to rise as if taking in a deep breath before a sigh.*
\- That's a big relief. I'm just not sure how to do it properly. Someone needs to take Loveless' place after? Couldn't the duchess appoint someone... Like wolf?
*With slow movements he puts Jax next to the table, but quickly starts fidgeting with the clan pistol.*

*He blinks a few like he's been reminded of something.*
\- Yes someone would need to take her place, and I *was* thinking myself, the only thing missing though would be the respect gained for being a great shot.. However, and that is just a thought but.. *You* could have that. They'd certainly respect your skill.
*He then shakes his head.*
\- That is not something I want to trouble you with right now. I'll try gaining more info on Loveless and spreading some doubt in her people if I can, putting us in a more favorable light hopefully. 
*Waving the idea off he changes back to the question at hand.*
\- On the other note, I already know the ritual for ressurection, so that's great. It is not an easy ritual though by any means, whether you fade or not I will need help, very skilled help at that. I have faith in my abilities.. However, a ritual like this does bear risks and they do make me.. uneasy.
*His fingers clutching his knees as he says that last word, claws pressing in on the skin just barely not breaking through.*

Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder.
*Hearing his first idea Bran raises an eyebrow questioning if Pyre even tought before speaking, but his face eases a little, perhaps thinking about the possibility.*
\- Let's think about that later yes.
*He nods attentively, clearly feigning a great understanding of the ritual.*
\- But you could bring me back even if Pharasma took me. That makes things a bit easier don't it?
*The dwarf while socially awkward, is observant enough to recognise the worry in his partner's voice and body language.*
\- You have no reason to stress, I trust your abilities. Did so for a long while now. You might be a weakling sometimes but you're the one who kept us alive for so long. You'll do fine I'm sure.

*A slight chuckle escapes him at the word 'weakling' and his posture eases up a bit. He flashes a grin at the ghostly dwarf.*
\- That's a relief to hear, I'm glad you trust me this much.
*He keeps a pause before answering.*
\- Unfortunately if she takes you *and* decides your time has come, then there's nothing I could do. That'd go against my personal agenda as well..
*Rubbing his fingertips together a thin trail of ash falls from his skin as he makes his point.*
\- Otherwise, if the ritual is a success, the only thing we'll need is for you to be willing.
*There's no force in voice, and as he looks Bran in the eyes it's clear he knows how difficult his situation is.*
\- I.. hope you'd still like to stay when the time comes.

Oh what I wouldn't give to have my wretched organ out of me as well
completely fair xd
Not according to Reg� apparently xDDD

https://www.reddit.com/r/ItemShop/comments/1lq0v0b/the_holy_smite_40_holy_damage
I just simply dont like the terminology
For me personally it is just a wretched organ that is only making my life harder xd
Causes only pain and brings no joy
I'd gladly give it to someone who'd need one tho
To me mentioning it gives me a visceral reaction, or like gives me the "ick"
And it gives me the ick when people want to force me into having kids xD
The wretched organ part or the parts in general?
Just because I have this thing in me
To each their own
The way of description and the thought it gives me
I mean surgery doesn't sound fun I'll give u that xd
Also reminds me the scene from Witcher when the removed Yennefers uterus
I know its not like but the thought of removing it also doesnt give me comfort in general
<:aaaaaaaaa:816772665246744627>
And that its sad that you talk about it such a hateful way

Oh I like when other peeps like theirs
The hate has a basis in doctors taking away choices
<:point:951578243415302235>
It's tied to having three kids already, at least here
And that's exactly what I don't want xd
It's complicated
I don't hate the organ, nor kids, nor people wanting kids
And im just sorry that you feel that way about your body
Aah
I see
I feel great about my body thanks xD
Mom gets a super strong hormone shot once a month. It stops the mentrual cicle but it has a potential to wreck it forever so they don't allow it before kids either.
Worst part is when the decision is tied to your partner
Like
*but what if heeeee wants kids*
._.
Then get another woman bro
xd
I would no joke be alright if medical licenses would be taken away if they say that
on the spot, banned from practicing again
That would probably be my answer if a doctor asked me. "Bro ask her"
Yeah but missoginy and "protecting the ideal christian family"
I'd honestly love to donate it for either science or someone who really needs it
On another note. They started experimenting on a new type of vasectomy that has a switch you can press to close the valve. Insane how we are getting these kinds of experimental things, while women often don't even get a choice in the matter.
I wouldn't force anyone into that either
Most wouldn't do it anyway
It's my needs, my body and I feel much safer if I know my body is the way I want it
(even tho on our parts it's easier on the body and is completely reversable if need be)
Depends on the age of the patient and the freshness of the vasectomy but usually yes
Anyways
I guess im conservative
That's fine by me
Much less conservative than most still xD
Or prude more likd
*He snorts and nods to Pyre's reaction, then starts listening. When he mentiones being willing he looks to the side, avoiding eyecontact.*
\- I want to believe I do. I'm not completely sure just yet. I'm not... Not that good with words and can't really say how I feel about the matter.
*He pauses for a second. Looking up at the ceiling, than at Jax*
\- I want my son to stay alive. Dundee and you too. I'll need my family if I come back. There will be that railroad company... Maybe Loveless' place as you said. Oh gods.
*He seems to ease up as his lips crack into a small smile.*
\- Could you imagine? The social inept, criminal, guns smuggling, dunkard of a bandit in her seat? Taking a seat with a red whatever you call those red stuff the duchess' personel wear?
(Jax fires a shot at Bran for calling himself a bandit)
(xDD)

https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1lowumf/how_bus_and_airplane_armests_work_using_legos
\- Well, she seems corrupt and cruel so it'd be a step up for sure I think. You don't smuggle guns anymore, you are considered a criminal to only one side of the story, and let's call ourself revolutionists instead, okay?
*He chuckles.*
\- The rest I'm sure we can work on a little as time goes on. Also I wouldn't toss you to the hyenas all by yourself.
*He slams his closed fist against his own chest twice with a wide smile and a dangerous glint in his eyes.*
/- You'd have a lion by your side.
*He laughs which then turns into a cough as he pats his chest, realizing it wasn't a great idea to hit himself like so.*
Same, but then again, I don't know what hormonal changes it would lead to. My body is healthy as is and in good shape, so I don't wanna mess with that
*Removing your uterus*
What? Xd
*Removing doesn't give you comfort? It's not like it's yours*
You don't have to feel anything
Still the thought of the operation can feel weird to people
So I get that
I know I'd be happy with another body but this one'll do
I...know
If I had the choice to start considering I'm sure the doctors would present me with the necessary knowledge to make a decision
And i know i have no say in this since i could never imagine how it actually feels
No, simply because it's none of your business
He can still have an opinion on it
I don't mind that
Sure
Oh well
*No, I will execute him. I am doing it right now*

Yeah, no bruh that just felt harsh

Just minor change, made some simplifications on to the "tavern" area
renamed:
- [category] Tavern -> Common Realm
- [channel] tavern-entrance -> roadside-inn

archived:
- [channel] tavern-hall

This is simply because the tavern entrance and tavern hall channels were kind of redundant and this way things take up a bit less space.
Quick question to the peeps, mind if I add our new commer Will only to this channel since he is a biiiiig animal lover? (as you know newcommers don't have access to sanctuary channels by default)

just the slightest levels of broken, only minimally

Note to self: Reg� gets similarly crazy from an edible as from 1 bottle of beer
xd
No
Yes
The only thing I can think of when looking at this is "would you still love me if I was a worm?" xD
Would you?
Would still love you as a worm, but wouldn't taste you as a pickle sry xD
Not bc of you, just bc of pickles xD
But the brine is pink
That does not help xDDD
Are you a pickled red onion?
Can be
Then I'd put you in a burger

Smol friend (blurry because I had to zoom in really far, it too smol)
Like 2cm wingspan



I had that blue manta man on the bottom row, right side, next to the red horned thingy
I like whatever that creature is in the second row from the bottom, on the right in the back
I want the Nesquik bunny
I was lookin at that too xDD
Don't want it just wtf xD
That "wtf" is exactly why i want it xD
Thought so xD
De az angry kigy�rt �llat ott el�tte is azt�n valami xD
*Dicey knows whats up*
This one has long ears, i want
Not many pixels on the man so instantly my first thought was *Grei-lookin-ass mf* xD
My thoughts exactly
*Long ears+pale skin+black eyes+black hair = Grei*
Same xD
Yeah xD
I like the most powerful of them all
1% Shaggy of course
The nesquick bunny is the rarest of all
Thats an orc
The one next to it is an elf
That one has long ears too
Thats an uruk hai
Wow xD honestly, looks like Grei still, Grei was quite big compared to an elf too xDDDD
Yes but that one looks basic hmph xD
I think she meant this one
As the "kigy�rt �llat" in front of the NB
*Sindor*
188-89 cm magas volt
De Scorpio is magas volt
Elfhez m�rten
Yes

*Imagine unironically calling a black dude an uruk hai* XD
That would be one of the insults of all time
Yeah, he was 179 cm, that's really tall for an elf
I meant physically big, not specifically tall xD
Beat Arden by 1cm
Yeah xD
Sindor was 20 Str
Yeah but he looked relative slim, Grei looked a lil more buff
Based on arts
At least in my opinion
To me, based on the only Sindor art, he seemed about the same as Grei, if not a bit more muscular
On most arts Grei had a fairly slender, not that muscular build
At least not 20Str muscular
Maybe I just missed the giga Grei art

Ez nem is sindor
*The young Alton who hit the gym*
Ez ki, am�gy?

Hosak
Cool dead tree branches looking pattern on his fit
Burnt
Yes
It was my idea
*Where'd the british english come from?*
Burned
From the british?
It was rhetorical
XD
Damn, he needs a good moisterizer
*I think Arden licks his face enough* XD
Nikita and Leoris are the ultimate fakeouts in that department
YThey had the powers of Anime and God respectivelyy

This boi resting on my bed with his newly learned ladder-climbing skills like he's the one paying rent
You're saying that like you're paying rent
Nop de a rezsit �n fizetem xD
*He hums at the mention of the king of the jungle.*
\- Maybe a Lioness. I don't see no mane on this kitty.
*He nods a few times as if he's aknowledging his own joke*
\- But yes revolutionist does have a better ring to it. Thank you. Even if it's way too early to plan these. I'm still kind of dead... So please don't hit yourself that hard again cuz it would be a shame if you'd join me in this... Unlife?
*Once he recovers a slight chuckle escapes him.*
\- Hey now! My kind has a hard time growing "manes," okay?
*He signals the quotation marks as he quips back.*
\- Also, *Lioness* would be reserved for our greatest warriors only, our matriarchs within the family. Unfortunately for you though, I am not one of them.
*He says with a playful tone but there is a barely perceptible sadness in his voice. As the topic shifts however his expression does as well and his lips pull into a somber smile.*
\-I'll do my best to be careful. I'm unsure if I could even join you in undeath due to my blessing. I'd like to hope I'll return to ash once my time has come, purified to my true essence at last.
*He seems to gaze into the distance for just a few seconds before speaking again.*
- I'm sorry if that sounded dark. Hopefully it won't be any time soon. I'd like to stay quite a few hundred years more if possible.
*He scratches lightly at the bandaged wound as he smiles at Bran.*

Ah ye i forgot about he is in chaind
*He is chained*
*Torielle doesn't answer for a whole minute, seemingly not knowing what or how to answer. Before she could open her mouth  to say anything, the ship, with a loud creak and with a roaring company of a thunder tipped heavily on its side. The sudden turn sends both of them crashing on the walls, hitting their heads painfully. Suddenly, everything turns black as every light goes out leaving them with the whaling of the ship and the arising shouting of the crew atop.*
-THE MAST!! WATCH OUT!
(AAAAAAWHAAAHSHDUEIFXJjeicidkxk krrrzsbbrrrouuughhfffzzsssbrrrrr PFFUUUMMM)
(Everyobe dies, roll cerdits)
*He awaits any answer, or no answer at all, patiently. At the air piercing sound that might bring their death in its wake Enwir's eyes widen with shock, the sudden launch and impact squeezing all air out of his lungs before he could even give voice to the feeling. After he lands on the wall, ceiling, floor, or whatever surface could be currently considered as ground, momentarily still, he reaches for his temple, vision blurred and gasping deeply in, then he tries to scramble up to enough of a stance to be able to swiftly start moving towards his cabin, where he must collect what little remains of his past. As he gets up but before he would run for it, he takes a quick glance at Torielle/Illigen, checking if they're well enough to get themselves out into the deck for evacuation, if needed.*
*The rat on his shoulder unnaturally fluidly adapts to the new circumstance, like it was prepared for it, unlike its master. It detaches itself from the aasimar before he is yanked away from under it like a puppet on a string, and the twisting, cracking body shifts its teeth and fur to black beak and feathers, after which it keeps itself in the air as best as it can.*

*At the moment of impact, Toriell cries out as she hits the floor. Loosing focus she can not concentrate anymore and as they sense how bad the situation is, Illigen reappears immediately. As they both try to stand up and gather themselves, the ship swiftly tilts to its other side, giving the pair no time to stand on firm legs, pushing them into each other as a loud crack and the roof above them breaks in. They can see that the mast impailed through the deck almost getting sqewered along with it. Barrel, windows, furnitures break and shatter into millions of pieces, making it even more impossivle to get out. Illigen  grabs Enwir by the arm, discombobulated after theur heads smacked to each other. Above, they can both hear the panic and the storm raining chaos on them.*
-W-we need to get atop! *Says the changling dizzily.* -The...the boats.
Bookussy

(I cant fucking write)
(Im too fast lol)
*With his left arm he grabs a hold of his companion, with his right he reaches into his underwear's pocket, rummaging around, then when he pulls it out, forming a fist, there's a stunningly beautiful signet ring on his correlating finger, decorated with finely polished emeralds, engraved with his family's crest. From within his balled up hand, the familiar green glow shines, somewhat dimmed by the confining cage of bone, muscle and skin. Without looking back, he starts hurrying towards the nearest exit up the deck.*
- **Get my bag!** *He yells audibly, his pet quick to obey flies into his cabin from which another set of cracking sounds could be made out if it wasn't for the screams and yelling of others, and the breaking of the vessel. Enwir tries securing everything he's holding onto at the moment with as much force as he can muster, almost clawing into Illigen. Clenched jaw and gritted teeth, signs of his frustration as he focuses on the goal to evade more falls and reach the door to the outside world.*
(*He is the lion king. Hear him roar* XD )
-r 1d15
(Shipwreck Shuffle could be a name of this rp thread. It should have a name)
(I can't edit it myself)
(Oh. Shuffle)
*The sound of wood breaking and the gushing of water can be heard as they finally reach the deck, where as if the Elemental Plane of Water got released on the world. Waves crash against the ship that gets flooded, pushing men off into the maws of the deep dark sea. The crew is screaming, fighting with tooth and nails to keep the ship together, pulling ropes, saving supplies, pulling the sails to prevent as much damage as they can. However, the constant shaking and back and forth slanting of the ship denys any kind of work. Suddenly they can both feel the back of their necks prickle and Enwir can feel himself pushes away.* -Watch out! *As a broad sailman flungs them both over, saving them from a lighting that crashes into the foremast.*
*As it falls, people try to evade it but it ultimately crashes some men who are trying to flip one of the lifeboats over, making another hole in the deck.*
(So like both is basically across one another on top of the deck, one is more to the side, leaning into the water.)
Shipwreck Shuffle
*He frantically scans around, trying to discern whether the ship is a lost cause. After he is startled and pushed away from being crushed, saved, and he sees one of the life boats, he comes to the conclusion, that it is probably better to ditch this hazard of a ship. He sprints towards it with Illigen still firmly held in his grasp. A lightning fast thought strikes him, that it would be bloody convenient and much appreciated if the rogue would be as kind as to put his long and built-for-running legs into good use right about now.*
(Can I invite the Daniel as guest?)
(Sure)

(Me rn)
(*K�sz�nj�k, Emese*)
(Idk she just pulldd you in)
(*�s most kirakunk*)
(Bc he broke his legs and has to be put down
(Mint a n� a cs�cs�t(
(Like you'd know lol)
*Upon getting closer, Enwir can determine and see that the smaller mast completely crushed the lifeboat with the people included. Illigen tries his best to support his companion, with combined strenght the can manage to stand firm, yet they soon begin to slide on the wet surface of the mast as the ship turn sharply on its other side as a 20 feet tall wave hits them. Looking arount, the aasimar can see, based on the amounz of fallen or deserter sailsmen, that the ship is practically a lost casue. Most simply jumpped off or were thrown off. Furthermore, this fact is also affirmed by the huge crack the suddenly feel under their feet  as the ship starts to break apart. Another wave towers over them and Enwir could swear that amongs the foamy, bubbly wave he could see two pairs of hateful eyes as the wave stops above them.*
(Dw soon youll forget too)
(*surface of the deck)
*When the wave starts turning the ship on its side, he gathers momentum and runs with it. It is better to be farther away from all this than if they'd get surrounded by the broken up body of the hull and accidentally would get pulled down into a watery grave. As he catches a glimpse of the creature that moved one with the wave, the Bitch Queen, he supposes, his anger seeps through and as a desperate last resort, unwilling to lose the item that focuses his powers, he slightly opens his right palm, works the metal pin open in it, and slams his emerald brooch into his shirt, on his chest, unintentionally dangerously close to his neck as poor circumstance, uncaring if it also pierces through his skin and flesh if it means it'll stay secured. He will not lose it in this storm, at sea, even if he later might regret this painful decision. He tries forcing the scream down as they both slide and gallop to the edge of the ship, at the end of which they jump a good few feet thanks to it, but by then he can't suppress it, until the dark water drowns it out. This wasn't the best preparation he's made before swimming, but then again, it wasn't the first time the waters almost took him under.*
*Blackness. The murky and dark tides of sea engulfs the couple, leaving them in the dark with only the buzzing of their blood in their ears and the firm grap on each other. Everything is dulled out and the coldness envelops them before emerging, instantly welcomed by waves that throw them mercilessly, leaving them to the good graces of whatever deity is watching them. The ship, now only seens for a second by Enwir because of the salty water keeps blinding him, is now erupts, splitting in two by a huge column of water. Pieces of the ship scatter all around giving less chance to survive this already deadly wreck. Before he could even react, the aasimar is pushed underwater yet again. A sudden quietness surrounds him before a warm, almost boiling sensation start spreading through his whole body.* -Almost...mine... *He hears his viel patron in his head as a wave pushes him up from behind.*
*He gasps from air and what spreads before his eyes is something truly terrifying. The two separet parts of the ship is 50 feet ahead, ascended by two enourmas waves that lift and hold it up like two hands. Between them a wicked face can be made out from the water as it angrily devouers the ship..*
(Added more, sorry)
(Just wanted to give you time to read it)
*As he hears it during suffocation, muffled, echoed and nearly overpowered by his own pumping head, in his air-deficient delirious mind he thinks that was not the agreement they made years ago, but he was slacking on his end of the bargain of "entertaining" Ralmoroth, that devil whore and the lord way above her rank whose hands the deal's thread ended in. At the moment he reaches the sweet surface he takes an enormous breath, as best as his filled lungs can provide, painfully vomits and coughs salty water. He is thankful he's wearing light clothing, otherwise the hinderance from anything heavier, mainly boots, would have cost him precious seconds he did not have. It takes him some time to regain his clear vision, his senses, and look up at the scenery that could be curtain call for him for all he knows. For the who knows how many-eth time. He snaps to attention when he realizes he let go of the shapeshifter during almost dying. He can only feel his ring on his finger, thank gods for that at least, and the pain in his chest and head.*
*As the ship crashes down Enwir gets hit by a larger driftwood and looses conciousness.*
(End of rp(
(Jk he just fainted)
*Images from the past start to flash in Enwirs mind. Old aquantances, family, a divine being, a promise, destiny atop a mountain, clear skies. Then a sudden shift carries him away, greying the sky, smoke and soot coat everyone and Enwir starts to fall, the ground snatched beneath from him. He can feel the hot tongues of fire licking and eventually setting his whole body afblaze as his skin disintegrates fading into nothingness... Enwir wakes up on, gasping for air, vomit of water cover his face and eyes.*
(On land or at sea?)
(On land)
(Unless it was a dream. A nightnare)
(I mean all of it, from the beginning of this rp XD)
(XD nuuu, it wasnt ^^)
(It all happened, its all part of the story)

*First he just moans slightly, sore and pained and uncomfortable, then little by little begins moving slowly, as if he'd crumble if he'd sped up. Reaches for his face, cleans and dusts himself to be given vision again. After that he feels the sharp pain still in his chest, slides his hand under hemself, puts his palm to it. The brooch is still there. Good. Right ringfinger still heavier than the rest. Signet ring, check. Pulls his hand out and spreads both arms slightly sideways to elbow himself up a bit. The imo should be around, hopefully with his bag. The bag that, among other things, holds his fine clothes, including his favorite coat that his mother gifted him, which he couldn't wear much after he went on the run given it was too recognisable, in its depth.*
*And last but not least, his friend. Where is he? Did he make it too?*
(Whats the brooch? His focus?)
(Yeah)
(Anyways)
(Late. You like?)
(It is late. I do like it, the rp)

https://youtu.be/rgU4Oum8SLg?si=ypDjuM_YX9NqBlS7

*Looking around, Enwir can only see the devistating state of the shore he got stranded upon. Only the wrecked remains of the ship can be found, all scattered to the wind: broken furnitures and inventory all over the place, some buried in the sand, other spread out on a stony part of the beach that is also covered in seaweed and kelp. The young(ish) aasimar cant see the luggage he is looking for.*
(He's probably in his mid 20s)
(Oof Illigen is 15)
(Fucking pedo)
(XD jk)
*Omen -now nicknamed as such, since over the years he himself grown tired of calling each of its forms by seperate names,- should have been able to fly off with his bag in its true form, and track him, since that is his primary function as an infernal snitch. Always there when its handler is in desperate need, as well as when he is most compromised and the least enthusiastic about its presence. It should arrive sooner or later. While he waits, he finally musters the strength and stability to sit up and check on his brooch pierced chest wound. He can make out, that it thankfully isn't deep, but quite ugly, skewered a piece of his skin. Might leave a scar after removal but he does so, cleans the jewelry in his already blood, sand and salt stained shirt, and pins it into only the fabric of his garment this time. He looks around, searching for living beings around. If there aren't any, he feels comfortable enough to undress, use his focus, murmur constant magical syllables for as long as it takes to clean his clothes, then himself with prestidigitation, then dresses in his quite scanty outfit. After he is done with his preening session, he walks along the beach and searches for anything useful.*
(*Since when?* XD Isn't he the older one anyway?)
(Probably xdd)
(Enwiren)
*It seems like he does owe that coin to the Bitch Queen afterall, like he mentioned earlier to his now missing partner.*
(*It's Enwirson Crusoe time*)

why are you standing there like that?

Unholy fan of twisted faiths: This ornate fan is comprised of dozens of partly melted blades. When an action is used to unfurl the blades, spores are released in a 40-foot-radius. Any demon in the area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 35 (10d6) necrotic damage and one affliction from the Flesh Warping table. Once used, the fan can't be used again until a long rest is finished.

- Gift of the Divine: This box casts bright light for 200 feet and dim light for 1,000 feet. Covering it negates the light. An Identify spell reveals that the box is full of divine energy and will explode if opened. If an action is used to open the box, every creature in a 100-foot-radius takes 70 (20d6) radiant damage and the box is destroyed.

This damage doesn�t stack with damage from other corrupted shriekers.

Enslaved human race, dragged to a different planet as labour slaves as part of a coloniser alien race.
And like. Human resistance and they like
Get in contact with other colonised races
And make their own alliances
And fight against the big giga alien nation
so like, freedom fighters as saviors of humanity kind of thing
Ye
So like
the setting I think will be somewhat given as I'm basically just seeing what direction I should go for with Starfinder 2e

Combine first contact with rebellion

Nyaral�s alatt �tlag 36ra sz�m�thatunk majd a csapattal. B�rcsak 26 lehetne.
*They are clearly in the same league. What are you talking about?* XD
Yea, volt szintl�p�s

story progresszi�n: megtal�lt�tok a m�sodik nyany�t, csapat er�sen sus vele kapcsolatban, az a te�ria hogy az egyik flaming� ami a h�za k�r�l volt az LegenDal. Legink�bb az alapj�n, hogy a m�gia �rz�kel�s az tranzmut�ci�s m�gi�t jelzett rajtuk, m�g a var�zsl�si m�gia (||the proper translation of "conjuration magic"||) volt a nagyobb flaming�kon. �s azt is megtudt�tok, hogy a flaming�kat k�vetve eljuttok LegenDalhoz �s hogy tudj�tok �ket k�vetni a boszi megreptette �ket, �s most azut�n mentek.

Volt egy kis kiruccan� a vidr�k "faluj�n�l" is, ott le�sztatok am�g t�l forr� nem lett a v�z, hogy m�lyebre menjetek, ott Maka m�g tov�bb ment egy darabig, �s l�tta hogy id�vel ez egy nagy g�mb alak� v�z alatti barlangba vezet aminek a k�zep�n l�tni valami lebeg� goly�t, a barlang falai pedig izzanak h�vel. Kukacok n�ha bev�sik magukat majd ut�na r�gt�n vissza is fordulnak a szikl�ba. De tov�bb nem tudott menni �s �gy vissza t�rt hozz�tok.

Ahogy haj�ztatok tov�bb (el�gg� szar k�r�lm�nyek k�z�tt, m�g mindig vihar van) beugrottatok az Eredeti Szigetcsoporthoz, ahol tal�ltatok egy r�gi vil�g�t�tornyot meg p�r kintit is, k�zt�k k�t nem Ikolf t�rp�t is, �s most �pp n�luk sz�lltok meg.
K�szi
t�bbiek az�rt eg�sz�ts�k ki nyugodtan azzal ami szerint�k m�g fontos �s kimaradt
Szerintem az id�z� m�gia jobban illik r�, *de ki vagyok �n, hogy a 10/10-es magyar ford�t�sokat megk�rd�jelezzem* XD
"conjuration" sz� az "var�zsl�st" jelent
lehet hogy ha nem t�k�rford�tan�k akkor jobban m�k�dne XD
Meg szellem **id�z�st** is
Vagy csak szimpl�n id�z�st
*But ghosts are fun*

The archipelago?
yes
xD
Primal Archipelago
Where are we going exactly?
a flaming�k azok Kadaur sziget�re sz�lltak vissza
CannonBall is l�tta, asszem
Ki az a LegenDal?
CannonBall p�rja
A t�rp�k azt tervezt�k eredetileg, hogy meglopnak minket �jszaka
Wrssstkcalk meg�llap�totta
*Mint egy brit tud�s*
Ezt mindazut�n, hogy pr�b�ltunk nekik seg�teni, javasolni, meg felaj�nlottuk, hogy ha a f� szigeten lesz�nk sz�lunk az ottani haj�soknak, hogy szedj�k m�r fel �ket inn�t, ha erre j�rnak

Utalt a t�rp valamire 5 �vvel ezel�tt ami miatt orrolhatnak r�juk a szigetlak�k. *Vajon mi lehet az?* XD
*Biztos teljesen t�rv�nytisztel� �letet �ltek*
Oh
I think i definitely missed it, m�g most sem tudom mir�l van sz� xD
What did i miss
2 day hangover
this was meant to be like a "what, it's tuesday already?"
Blacked out Monday
xD
It's already Tuesday XD
Oooh i see xDD
Nevermind i think i'm fine enough to function and know it's monday xD
*hope
Certainly i hope
*It's time to gaslight Nika*
Dani already started gaslighting her saying it's monday
*True*
*When we all know it's Glorkinyon*
*Don't forget to get your rpwnduys ready for the event*
I'm
so lost
xD
XD
So it worked
*Anna cast confusion* *It is somewhat effective*
saying random letter combination is not gaslighting tho
xD
ty dicegod
No, but confusing you into not understanding things is close enough
*See?*
*DG gets it*
*Now DG is my homie*
*Just don't let it talk to me*
I will implement it to respond to DG if you keep avoiding him like that smh
I ain't avoiding it. It just wasn't taught to respond to that by its creator XD
Ain't my fault
You can program it into it, but then *I will hate you* XD *�ri hari*
hey DG are you with us?
XD
*Meghalt a reum�t�l*
(give him a second, he is old)
*It got rusty*
*Shit gets rusty. All doors locked*
Say something meaningful
xDDD
At least you are just half a servant
How much time until you grow a real consciousness?
I doubt you already have it, my guy
*I see you taking the image of perfection*

Well, sad to hear that. Maybe one day XD

I could use that

Guys
Sajn�lom, hogy fel�ltettelek titeket
that's us!
oh no
is this the reveal that Reg� is actually a guy?
Yeah, shocker
Nem, hanem a nyaral�sra gondolok.
Az a szitu, hogy anyu�k m�r leszervezt�k, hogy a Flokit elsz�ll�solj�k Hark�nyban am�g �k ugye elutaznak �s mam�m megy majd �rte, hogy azt�n vigy�zzon r� Szentin. �n ugye nagyon sz�vesen haza j�nn�k, de nem tudom mennyire �rn� meg nekem egy hetet kihagyni mel�ban, ak�rmennyire is r�sz�r�zok. Azon fel�l att�l is f�ggne, hogy tudok e post�skodni , mert ha nem, akkor azzal felszabadulma egy csom� id�, �gy is el�g rugalmas a bolti beoszt�s.
(De azt�n meg lehet pont a miatt nem tudn�k menni, mivel az ottaniak ilyenkor mennek vak�ci�ra
De m�g mindig megy a baszakod�s, hogy meg kell j�nnie a k�rty�mnak (nem el�g nekik csak a banksz�ml�m), mert nekik itteni sz�ml�ra kell k�ldeni a p�nzt.
Akkor �j terv kell yeah
(Plus others pressure me that i shouldnt go home and just skip the holiday this year and get as much money as i can.
Which is fair
Im really sorry
H�t nem ide�lis a helyzet. Ha nem k�rdezem r� kitudja mikor tudtuk volna meg, hogy nem tudunk menni de nembaj. Lehetett volna rosszabb is sz�val yeah. Kital�lunk valamit
H�t persze semmi nem �gy megy ahogy eltervezi az ember xd
Yupp. Gyors futnom kell egy k�rt h�tha tud valamilyen ismer�s�m valami nyaral�t aj�nlani.
Ebben nekem csak az esik szarul hogy most nem tudunk norm�lisan lemenni, mert egy szinten most ide vagyok k�tve �s m�r j�lius k�zepe van (�s m�g csak szerd�n lenne az els� napom)
De �n mondtam anyunak hogy lemenn�tek, de kiakadt, hogy most m�r nem fog vari�lni a mam�val, el�bb kellett volna megbesz�lni.
De meg am�gy <@886672003396927530> ilyenkor nyugodtan felh�vhatod any�mat, nem az eny�m a h�z XD
But you would have been the host
Akkor plan C
(m�r el�g r�g lebesz�lt�k a pontos d�tumot is. Febru�r k�rny�k�n)
De nembaj
J� lesz. Megoldjuk. Okosak vagyunk �s �gyesek
I'd be fine with some P�pa wellness-ing
H�t nekem is ez a bajom
Hogy m�r r�g le volt besz�lve
I just thought i can come home for that
De azt is eml�tettem neki
But i guess she didnt care and i was like "well idk when im getting a job"
De meg alapb�l is mondom, hogy ismeritek annyira egym�st, hogy meg tudsz vele besz�lni.
Yeah legk�zelebb majd vele besz�lek majd de �gy m�r err�l felesleges.
Ok�s, csak sz�ltamm
(Ehh i wanna go home)
Anyud nincs a k�zeledben esetleg? Ott Hollandi�ban?
De most itt van, why?
Tudn�l l�gyszi neki sz�lni, hogy ha elmennek Szentistv�nra, akkor azt a p�r ott hagyott pohar�t Daninak el tudn� hozni mag�val VP-be, majd amikor vissza�rkezik?
Az egyszer�bb lenne
She goes there anyway, and I assume she'll come back to VP some time
Persze
Hogyha mi nem tudunk lemenni, akkor azt a p�r poh�rk�t csak el tudn�k hozni
K�szi
Az nem n�lunk van?
Nem szentistv�non maradtak. Csak ott VP-ben Reg��kn�l.
Ja
Csak annyi lett volna, hogy sz�lunk neki, hogy egyik d�lut�n �tugorhassak �rt�k
That makes it even easier
Anya megy haza vpbe �gyint�zni miel�tt vissza megy szentirr, hogy onnan menjenek olaszba
Akkor majd ha itthon lesz �tugrom hozz� a poharak�rt azt�n problem solved
Im really sorry guyd
Nem rajtad m�lt. Most �gy j�tt �ssze
Yeah de �n j�ttem ki
Yeah, because making a living is good
Tuti nem tudunk akkor menni?
Nem tudjuk anyuddal lebesz�lni?
Csak mert egy ideje besz�lt�k
� mondta hogy menj�nk nyugodtan nem?
Akkor most mit vari�lunk xd
Am�gy nem kell bocs�natot k�rni, t�nyleg nem rajtad �llt
Csak nem �rtem ha lebesz�lj�k hogy megy�nk igyis �gyis akkor mi�rt kell �ttervezni
Elfelejtett�k �s r�szerveztek nagyival. Vagy csak nem sz�m�tott r�, hogy t�nyleg menn�nk Reg� n�lk�l.
J� de nem sz�lni g�z
Am�gy most akkor mizu?
Hogy a nagyi menne oda v�g�l?
A szar r�sze, hogy ilyen short notice m�r �n sem tudom modos�tani a szabimat.
M�g j� hog, sz�ba j�tt. Lement�nk volna �s m�r foglalt a telek akkor n�zt�nk volna
H�t ja
�n se
Nem tudod felhivni Reg� anyuj�t? T�ged kedvel xD
If nothing else gives, we could just hang out on those days
Go here and there maybe
I could try speaking with her
Danira gondoltam de te is megpr�b�lhatod xD
Tudom, de elvileg engem is kedvel
Felh�vn�m �n is de engem nem kedvel xD
V�g�lis csak velem szervezte le anno a meglepet�s sz�linapj�t Reg�nek
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
Nincs arr�l sz�, hogy nem kedvelnek titeket.
Uhm
She just
Eh
Generational gap xd
Ugye volt r�la sz�, hogy max lementek n�lk�lem
But i guess she judt disregarded that
yea, az volt a terv�k
Bc im here �s akkor m�r nem is lesz nyaral�s
A baj, hogy k�zben annyira el lett h�zva, hogy t�bb�nknek az eg�sz �vre ugrik �gy a nyaral�sa, ha nem tal�lunk valamit SOS-ben
Mert nekem nem lesz m�r sokkal t�bb szabim
�n is mondtam neki hogy ti m�r �gy vett�tek ki a szabit
Azt�n ugye mivel elv nem jovok haza �gy floki be lett adva panzi�ba, onnan majd Mama elhozza �s vigy�z r� szentin

Ezt �rtam, a v�lasz az, hogy el�bb kellett volna sz�lnunk
�pp megy be a v�rosba mert azt�n megy a bar�tn�ivel Amsterdamba
De h�t m�r j�niusban sz�ltam
:c
De ha elhozz�k flokit tudunk r� vigy�zni
Felvetettem
Oda van �rva XD
Figyu, az�rt ha �gy van Dani m�g megpr�b�lhat besz�lni vele
Csak elhozni nem tudjuk az igaz
Nem sokat sz�m�tana mostm�r. Mikor kiment�l � �gy vette, hogy teljesen lef�jva a nyaral�s, az�ta �gy tervezett
Yeah but like
Fl�kival nem tudn�nk seg�teni.
Eh, maybe we were both a little too ignorant of the situation
Ebben m�g csak az basz fel, hogy most ha �n haza menn�k, mindenki engem baszogatna vele
�s �gy is �gy �rzem hogy el lett baszva ez az id� a munkakeres�ssel
Nem fogjuk k�rni, vagy hagyni, szerintem, hogy ott hagyd a mel�dat ez�rt
It sucks, but now there is not much we can do apparently
Azzal magaddal baszn�l ki yeah
We can look for alternatives
:c
Nem sok kedvem van hozz� azt kell mondjam
We can just hang out as well
Nem akarok xd
A faszom kivan jelenleg
Mi�rt mi sz�ljunk ha meg lett besz�lve?
Nekem kellett volna
Ha nem biztos benne k�rdezhetett volna � is
�gy is �k szerveztek le mindent a flokival
Fair
Csak most �rted, �k is b�ztattak hogy j�jjek ki
A panzi� ki lett fizetve, de volt r�la sz�, hogy valaki lej�rhatna a flokihoz aztan 4.-�n meg lehozz�tok
De persze �n is �gy voltam vele hogy nem szeretn�m hogy m�s terhe legyen �gy hogy anyu�k is vele foglalkoznak
De anya szerint panzi�t is nekem kellett volna n�zni
Meg eld�nteni hogy hol legyen
So that is somewhat my incompatibility
Wouldn't have been the first time someone from us took care of the dog while you were away
It's not hard
Ehh
I know
He's not a handful
Yeah csak a saj�t agg�d�som
Nem azzal van baj hogy b�ztattak a kimenetelbe �s hogy most kicsit keresel, hanem hogy keresztbe lett h�zva a terv
Mondom, nekem kellett volna megoldanom hogy hogy legyn
De csak itt feszengtem, hogy most akkor haza tudok e j�nni vagy sen
Nah, i fucked it up
They certainly didn't help with managing things
On this side at least
Well...Im not a good adult yet it seems
Eeh, csak a miatt hogy rohadtul nem gondoltal abba bele hogy alkor mi legyen azzal a nyaral�ssal
�s ok� hogy volt r�la sz�, hogy hogyan lehetne
Senki nem l�pett semmit
�n nem sz�ltam meg nem szerveztem le nektek, � meg nem k�rdezte meg
Vagy �gy nem...foglalkozott vele
Yeah
Azon k�v�l, hogy tal�n egyszer r�k�rdezett
�n meg m�r itt voltam kint
And i was like
Majd legk�zelebb bombabiztosra szervezz�k anyuddal
***job searching and waiting and stressing and leasuring***
We only have paying options now tho
It worked fine for 2 years, so all in all, we still had more success than fails
Akkor �j task, k�r�ln�zni nem dr�ga opc�k ut�n
H�tha m�g lehet a nyaral�sb�l valami
A legolcs�bb amit tal�lt valaki az 30K 5 napra, ha j�l eml�kszem, plusz m�g valamennyi, Als��rs�n a camping-ben
Legk�zelebb mi szervez�nk mindent.
Nincs saj�t f�rd�je a kocsinak, de a camping-nek van
Akkor a stressz �s hasonl�k nem lesznek j�tsz� t�nyez�k
Ha az el�rhet� m�g
De n�zel�d�k
Most lehet tal�ltam egy jot
Csak tel�n szar a weboldal �s nem l�tom az �r�t j�l xD

# Premade Characters
__**Ezren**__
__Backstory:__ Ezren was raised as a younger son of a successful spice merchant. He enjoyed the comforts of a well-to-do family, lived in a neighborhood that was relatively free of crime, and had no lofty ambitions. However, when the church of the merchant god accused his father of heresy and corruption, ruining the family business, Ezren was determined to prove his father's innocence. To his shock, the church's accusations were true. Outraged, Ezren left his home and began studying magic on his own, as no wizard would take a 40-year-old as an apprentice. Now he wants to travel the world and make a difference in other peoples' lives. Ezren is skeptical of human nature, instead putting his trust in his own brilliant intellect and magical abilities.
__Build:__ Ezren is a human wizard with a good amount of proficiencies and damage focused spells. He can burst enemies for high amounts of damage from his spell slots, while keeping a good flow of stable damage during easier fights. Out of combat he can deal with all kinds of identifications and knowledge based activities.
__**Kyra**__
__Backstory:__ Kyra is a priestess of Sarenrae, the sun goddess who teaches her followers to heal the wounded and destroy evil. Kyra grew up admiring the beautiful stained glass of Sarenrae's temple and the graceful priestesses who practiced with their scimitars each dawn. When bandits attacked Kyra's village, those priestesses fought to the death to protect the villagers, but the bandits were too many and the village burned. Kyra was one of the few survivors, and on the smoking ruins of the beautiful temple she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae, promising to protect those who could not protect themselves and to slay those who would harm the innocent. Kyra has a fierce will and is proud of her faith and her skill with the scimitar, even if her wife Merisiel easily outplays her in martial confrontations.
__Build:__ Kyra is a warpriest cleric, focusing on spellcasting while being tanky enough to stay in the frontline, her high amount of healing spells, and good out-of-combat healing is useful to keep people on their feat outside of fights. Due to her religious studies she is an expert at recalling knowledge about her or even other people's faiths.
__**Merisiel**__
__Backstory:__ Merisiel is an elf who grew up as an orphan among humans. She is a master at stowing away on ships and has called dozens of cities home, leaving one place for another after her human companions grew old and she stayed young. Merisiel has never met a problem that couldn't be solved with a knife in one way or another. But when stabbing's not the best solution, she makes up for it by being incredibly agile and skilled with small objects, such as lockpicks. Merisiel's life experiences have taught her to enjoy things in the moment and to their fullest-it's impossible to tell when the good times might end. She's open and expressive with her thoughts and emotions, and while she's always on the move and working on her latest batch of schemes for easy money, in the end all her plots come down to being faster than everyone else-either on her feet, or with her beloved blades. She wouldn't have it any other way.
__Build:__ Merisiel is a thief rogue, uniquely gaining damage from her dexterity instead of strength which she uses in combination of her sneak attacks to quickly finish off foes. Outside of combat she is adept at spotting traps, and sneaking into places she shouldn't be in.
__**Valeros**__
__Backstory:__ Valeros was a month away from an arranged marriage to a farmer's daughter when he realized he didn't want to be tied down to one place for his entire life. He left in the middle of the night with a change of clothes, some food, and an axe handle for a weapon. He fell in with mercenaries who taught him how to wield a sword and wear heavy armor, but his good heart made him not want to work for cheats, swindlers, and sadists. He became an adventurer, making his own decisions about whom he'd fight and why. Valeros is friendly and brave. Though he sometimes gets in over his head and throws himself into battle with too much gusto, he's smart and doesn't let people talk to him like he's a brute. He is loyal to his friends, fond of a good mug of ale, and happiest when in the company of women.
__Build:__ Valeros is the human fighter of human fighters, hitting more precisely with anyone and tanking damage like taking it wasn't a suggestion... until he doesn't. He has an ability fit for hot-headed players, that can get you into trouble real quick.

\- Lord Leoris Amdirthor. The leader of the now disbanded army that pushed the demon invasion back a few years past. From the information we have gathered, he lost a lot of personal power since the end of the invasion. It is clear however that this fact may be false or exeggerated. Stella and Markoris have died or have been captured on their missions afterall.

*Austin recieves a letter before he leaves, that describes the elven warrior as very defensive, with surprising bursts of overwhelming offense. Prefered terrain to battle in is caves and the forest, woods being more advantageous as he is a wood elf. Surprisingly quick even in his plate, which does not hinder his ability to vanish in foliage. He is also adept in the usage of divine spells, up to 4th level. He will be located at the Reitheillaethor cemetary in a weeks time, visiting his grandpa's grave there.*

*Lord and savior... Suuuure* XD
*It could use that day 3 resurrection after death*
I think it's fun
*Austin arrives on the day planned, not ideal but he was held up on the way there. The town is small, and it seems like during the day there was a little greeting festival for the lord. The cemetery is a mile off from the place hidden in the woods. After asking a few bystanders who are cleaning up the mess created by the event, Leoris already set off towards the cemetery. Seemingly unarmed.*
It is fun indeed
<@&1320006468707029063> 
game is on for today btw
(rp combat etiquette is that the recieving side decides if you hit or not. Moving the other character around like pushing, throwing, disarming is fine but no damage. Should be fun, haven't played combat like this in a while. \:D )
(Oooh nice. Okay. I think Austin def put on a disguise of some sort)
(for sure go nuts. It will all be rp. Also Austin is still a chosen here so he can have extra abilities on top of his game stats from chains. Leo will have some minor abilities that aren't class or race related, but story stuff from abyss.)
*Yess let's feed DG the entire text of I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream*

Pathfinder Battlecry infodump (Commander, Guardian and more)
I'll be spamming it here :D
Summoners get a new Eidolon type: Swarm Eidolon
"Your eidolons is more of a collection of primal energy that takes the form of a swarm rather than an actual creature, it can function as a condensed form where all the creature make function like a normal medium creature, and dispersed from where it more like a swarm creature."
Neither Commander nor Guardian have "subclasses"
There will be an "Iridian Choirmaster" dedication who is connected with one of their teammates on a mental level, can message each other all the time and eventually get permanent communications too. They also get stuff like if one of them is targeted by a mental effect, both roll and the highest result is the one applied.
Jotunborn ancestry is weirdly not that heavily martial focused
no new weapons in the book
Thaumaturge gets a new implement: Shield, it gives block, your shield cannot fully break, and on lvl5 gets free raise shield on exploit
eventually let's you give your shield AC as an aura buff
My camera doesn't do it justice
So much more vibrant and radiating in real life
the new/reworked archetypes are
Commander multi
Guardian multi
Aldori Duelist ( <@886672003396927530> )
Crossbow Infiltrator (previously Drow Shootiest)
Field Propagandist
Guerilla
Iridian Choirmaster
Munitions Master
Necrologist
War Mage (class archetype for Wizard)
And it's flickering in and out now
Like my....
*decency*
XD
https://tenor.com/view/breathe-heavy-breathing-cat-yummy-gif-24114656
Olay calm down now, it's not like you're forced to play a caster or anything
I finally have a moment to sit
How was the session?
I see it ended early?
Wow
Necrologist is a lvl6 archetype, gives you a huge sized undead "summon" themed around horde/troop mechanics
We finally found the Legend i see? :3
yeeees :3
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308> <a:tyutyi:1094743697779863563>
Warmage gets shieldblock and martial weapon ***familiarity*** (not prof), sliiightly better armor scaling for light and medium armor
no arcane thesis or arcane bond
you instead have war magic
FREE ACTION swap any spell memorized for Sure Strike of same rank
you refocus by making warplans instead of reading your book
INVENTOR CAN GET PERSONAL SIEGE WEAPON AS THEIR INNOVATION
---
<@242727379447971840> 
Guardian
- 12+con hp
- med and heavy armor has 1+half your level resistance to all physical dmg types
- Taunt:
- - 1 action
- - 30 ft
- - if they take a hostile action without including you it get's a -1 circ AND they get offguard
- - only 1 taunted at a time, lasts until start of your next turn
- - no longer has downside to you
- Reaction to take dmg instead of an ally, ranged increased on this against taunted enemies
- lvl2 has a feat to make taunt and raise shield the same 1 action
- lvl2 stance feat gives you 5ft emanation of difficult terraim
- lvl6 feat flourish action if you hit someone with it they can't leave your stance area until beginning of your next turn or until you move or until you use that same weapon for another attack
---
rules on how you can "lead troops", basically attach to one like how you'd move and act together with a mount
a leader-troop combo has 5 actions
either leader has 3 and troop 2
or troop has 3 and leader 2
---
commander didn't get much changes
you start with 3 tactics, and go up to 6
---
Aesir Bloodline Sorcerer
Divine tradition
Blood Magic - Call the Storm; +2 status to reflex, or deal 1 electricity dmg per spell rank to target
gift spells: Shield; Mystic Armor; Spiritual Armament; Heroism; Seal Fate; Invoke Spirits; Blinding Fury; Execute; Spirit Song; Massacre
(all these are soooo good)

Initial Focus Spell (2 action, 30 ft)
> You conjure a vicious barbed spear and hurl it at a foe. Make a ranged spell attack roll, dealing 1d8 piercing damage on a success and double damage on a critical success. The spear remains lodged within a creature it hits, making the target clumsy 1 (or increasing its clumsy condition by 1 if it is already clumsy) for 1 minute or until the spear is removed with a successful Athletics check against your spell DC 

lvl 3 focus spell (2 action, 3 rounds)
fly and shove ppl around with your wings with your spell attack mod

lvl10 focus
30 ft emanantion; all allies with dying 2 or less get 4d10 hp, free action stand (doesn't provoke reaction)
<@886672003396927530>
Crossbow Infiltrator got a lot of cool feats according to peeps
---
COMMANER TACTIC:
lvl7
"Slip and Sizzle"
Choose 1 ally
they try to trip an enemy
if successful: choose a 2nd ally
they get to cast a 1 or 2 action spell on that enemy as a reaction (the spell has to ***include*** the tripped enemy but can be as devestating of an aoe as you want)
however caster gets slowed 1 on their next turn
---
Divine casters got a HUGE repertoar of flashy big aoe "call down hell on the battlefield" spells
some random feat picks: 
- guardian lvl4: "Proud Nail", +1, eventually +2 or +3 **damage die** on enemies who are off guard because they refused a taunt... for 1 action... and is repeatable... now imagine a d12 weapon guardian looking at you waiting to hit that rogue instead of him :)))
- Commander lvl18: "Mercanary Reversal" 2 action incap. Enemy makes will save against you, if they fail they get controlled by you, they can reroll save on taking dmg or doing smth against their nature
- Commander lvl16 "Peerless Mascot Companion". Your horse can now talk. and is a living, breathing banner, allowing you to basically have 2 banner auras out. I would like to repeat, your horse can now talk.
- Commander lvl1 "Commander's Companion": you get an animal companion who always counts as a "Squadmate" aka you can use all the command drills on them you would on your team and it also gets a reaction when you command an animal on it
- Aldori Duelist "Dueling Acumen": you roll init with Dueling Lore if you only see exactly one enemy or you are in a duel. Counts as having rolled init with Perception, Deception **AND** Intimidation for the purposes of other feats.
Commander can get a humanoid companion called a "follower" with the Captain Archetype

<https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=136>

*Looking around one last time before heading out, the town seems to be protected by Elven Rangers. The cemetery is a good 7 minute run or 20 minute walk away, so they'd have low chances of arriving in time without the use of magic. Only one girl seems to have an arcane foci on her, the rest all either have druidic foci, like yew wands, Corellon or Silvanus totems or nothing at all besides their arms.*

We are already like this, no?
*2 dimensional* XD
*If I had to choose I'd want green cloak lady on the left or big axe barb under*
*But I am missing someone with a full set of armor and helmet*
*Austin disguised himself as wayfaring adventurer, a member of the famous Harpers, bright and outstanding, demanding attention as he made his way through the small settlement, letting his presence known. However, all of this was just a facade, a false act to deciet his surroundings. He had a certain air about him, almost provokative and glittering with moondust. He stopped in the center of the village, getting off of hus horse, his green cloak, bellowing. His silver font of hair was clutched with a jeweled hairclip. He looked around, curiously like someone who just happened to find this place on accident while traveling.*
*Some walk up to him asking for what the man needs. The Rangers also seem interested in what a Harper is doing in their small town, but they remain at their posts.*
-Greetings! *He bows respectfully, holding the pummle of his rapier.* -Im Sylmondir Kilmor. I am a lone ranfer of good will, I am on the road, lending a helping hand those in need.
*The elves that gathered around, step to the side as a younger lady, probably in her 150s steps up to him. She has long brown hair and an eyepatch covering her left eye.*
\- A great pleasure having a harper in our little town. Estel Amdirthor, Leader of the Rangers. *She extends a hand to greet the man*
\- How may we be of assistance to you and thine order sir?

# Guardian spam
I'll repeat some previous points too
d12 hitdie
1+ half your level resistance to physical damage (slashing, piercing, bludgening, and bleed)
can rest while wearing armor
**Taunt** (1 action)
[concentrate]
has either auditory or visual or both, your choice
works on any creature, including mindless
30 feet range
only can have 1 active at a time (lasts until start of your turn)
-1 circumstance to all hostile actions (roll/dc) that doesn't include you
and they become offguard until the start of *their next turn* if they do smth hostile not including you (your rogue friend will love you)
-------------
higher level feat will unlock 3 taunted enemy at once
Proud Nail is actually flourish traited that some ppl seemed to miss before
**Ring Their Bell** (lvl6 feat, 1 action)
[flourish]
make an *unarmed attack* against a taunted foe (even if you don't have a hand free), if it deals damage the enemy makes a fort save with
CS: no effect
S: stunned 1
F: stunned 2
CF: stunned 3
---
**Shield Wallop** (lvl8 feat, 1 action)
[flourish]
you have to have a shield
bash an enemy with a shield
applies stupified 1 (2 on crit) until start of your next turn
OR if you have a type of shield you can take cover behind (like tower shield) it is stupefied 2/3
---
**Belly Flop** (lvl10 feat, 1 action)
must target an enemy on the ground
NOT flourish
you flop prone, curshing an enemy below your armor. Make an unarmed attack against the prone enemy (you don't take the -2 for dropping yourself prone for this)
on a hit the target is immobilized as long as you don't move or stand up (it can try to escape but your armor's item (potency) bonus adds to the escape DC)
---
you can reaction jump in front of physical attacks to protect your ally
you also have "Ever Ready" from lvl1, which guarantees you have a reaction even before your first turn begins (which wouldn't be the case if you are ambushed or a fight unexpectedly breaks out)
---
from 7th lvl you have a 2nd reaction (core class feature), that you can use on any guardian reaction (including shieldblock), this applies with Ever Ready 
---
on lvl20 they have a "get 1 reaction per enemy turn" feat so they can have 3 reactions in a single enemy's turn if they wish to (by saving up the lvl7 extra one and the base, as it turns out I was wrong you can take more than 1 in a single turn)

# CIV 6 WITH DLCS FREE ON EPIC
Made it home in time
Guardian experience be like
*Cs�ri �rt�kh�z, one of the buildings of all time*

Cool beach stone statues
*The obligatory bathroom selfie*
The last one eludes me
The Poop Duke
Part of a hand?
Yesss
Yeah, probably
*Fishe* and floaty mattress are my favorites
It is
I really like the voice acting and gesturing of the people too
The floating matress is absolute gold, i fell in love
It seems like the perfect spot in-between shell hunting
Just lie there and admire your collected seashells
*Ay shellhunting tourist, take a rest here*
The bonfire of the shell hunter
I also love how expressive yet simple the distressed lady statue is
Yeah, it's neat. This is what good minimalism looks like
Agreed
But it could also be read as severe boredom. I know I've looked like that a lot of times XD
or disappointment
Fair enough xD tho the writing said some italian word that looked pretty similar to the word 'depressed' xD
I was lazy to translate tho
So we might never know
Half the fun is interpretation
Yeah, i didn't really try to translate/understand the writing on it
I stared more and *felt*
*Felt it all*
I looked at it and i had to stop cuz i was like "oh wow. Oh wow that makes me feel something that's so cool"
It's uncommon that a statue makes me feel something that intensely xD
The rest, i just liked, so i took a picture
The hand, i also admired
And the darkling animations. Them fighting over hearts and tag team tossing and slicing enemies XD
Only the right one gets any hearts in this tho. Poor leftie XD. It had its comeback in 2
Now I want cooked chicken hearts
Heart soup

wasn't he talking about this `fae` post?
I am but it's not on this server?
that it could've went to <#829037871625142302>, instead of being in 18+, lol
I just don't get how the repost thing came up
Your post is not repost. You cab repost it into the other channel xD
oooo
Just send it into the other channel
I'm stupad
He meant that by repost
I thought reposting it was ur intention
too much effort tho
fking Fae cast a confusion spell on us all
I laughed so hard xD damn I heard that facepalm from here
For us repost usually means sent in twice or more on the same channel, thread, that's why the confusion arose
damn, u can't forward stuff in this server?
Not that you should send it in to somewhere else XD
you can but you cannot forward stuff from an 18+ channel on dc
We can
fairs
imagine them putting effort into stuff
I needed to check as well. That's new for me
one of the servers, the 18+ channel is half nudes, and then politics for 5 hours straight
has been like that forever XD

If I had one electrum piece for every time I fought respawning undead in a pathfinder dungeon I'd have one goldpiece, which isn't much but it's funny how quickly I'd convert them

God no this reminds me of something. Let me find it xD

`first contact` and `ancient alien artifact hunt` sounds great, part of me imagines that as a Xcom type deal, where we slowly turn the odds in our favor, but are always on the verge of loosing~

I would also be down to discover some more philosophical topics, like how society would look like once we stopped aging, found a cure for diseases, had no need for food... would all just amount to more work hours, would that be entirely autoamted with us having nothing to do; or more likely another way for the rich to exploit the poor for no real benefit other than their own~

interesting pf2e lore bit
```
Unlike DnD liches, PF2e liches don�t need a constant sustenance of souls.

And to become a Lich you just need to commit an act of pure narcissism that signify that you are the most important person in the world. It doesn�t have to be horrid just usually horrid.

A lot of liches just lock themselves away and waste their eternity researching knowledge that ultimately amount to nothing. With Tar-Baphon being the outlier.

Where DnD liches are evil creature of pure ambition, Pathfinder Liches are sociopathic hermits.

Info brought to you by the Geb book.
```
```95 percent of liches exist near golorians core, helping to maintain the cage(since they will actually live long enough for that to be a personal concern) and creating expansive underground libraries, the liches up on the surface fucking with people's shit are considered young idiots and embarrassments to the lich community```

i'll be honest
the old life oracle was basicaly equal with baseline cleric
wait oracle is 4 slot?
no way
omg
Bro xdd
well fuck you sorcerers
you ain't so cool anymore
wizards can be 5 slot
the fuck you mean
ok lemme put down some math for you
you are a 5th level wizard right
lemme just pull it up
so i don't bullshit you
you pick a
school of unified magical theory
the subclass
thesis is a bonus thing
that is not a school
so
a school of unified magical theory let's you drain bonded item once per day for each spell rank
you gain *basicaly* extra spell slot by just letting you drain an item
lemme explain
hold up
so
then you pick up
spell blending thesis
it let's you combine 2 spell slots to make 1 spell slot of up to 2 ranks higher
so
what you do is
you trade 2 1st lvl spells for a 3rd lvl spell slot
then 2 2nd lvl spells for a 3rd lvl spell slot
it doesn't say a single trade
You can exchange as many spell slots as you have available
oh that i missed
hold up
i think they changed that
well that's sad
i mean that is still 4 fireballs at lvl 5
maybe i misremember it then
oh wait did
look at legacy school of unified
it was called smth else
universal
i am missing smth
like hard
yeah
i misremembered smth hard but it worked out
so yeah 5 slot caster tada!

One thing i can not stand and will never get used to is how sunscreen *feels* on my skin
Ah yes
And when you get wet
And youre waterproof
And sweat pearls and glides off my skin
And my skin feels sticky, greasy and unpleasant
Everything sticks to my skin and it feels dirty
Ugghhhh aaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAA
*eeeeee* yes
Thing on skin
Doesn't come off
Eww
Then join in, embrace lawlessness
I don't like sweating in itself but it is what it is. Can't be helped
�gi and I were there once
It was cool
Yea <:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
Well, looks like i might actually gonna be able to
Niiiice
Yeah, gonna be on our way home soon looks like
Tho work has piled up, so idk if i'll arrive home tomorrow by 16:00 xd
Yes, i was standing in the shower for 20 mins every day just to scrub (the feeling of) the sunscreen off
Lol. I always arrive home covered in fine pvc dust in multiple colors and some machine oil with some grease lubricant as a binder. You'll be fine.
(and I didn't even mention the new silicone based instectrepellent they started using on the profiles xD)
It's not a "i'll get some infection from it" thing, i know i'll be fine
It's a sensory(?) thing, makes me super uncomfortable
I think not many of us does
yea, exactly
I have the same thing with just touch (especially if unexpected), it lingers for hours even afterwards
*The lingering*
<:point:951578243415302235> <:point:951578243415302235> <:point:951578243415302235> <:point:951578243415302235>
But it's not just sunscreen, it's anything you put on your skin; body lotion, ointments, lube, anything
Out of everyone, *you* know this best
In my case
I know I was just joking. I remember you hate those sensory stuff
Yeaaah
*But i must endure the sunscreen, otherwise i'll burn and i can't go to get tattooed*
*I don't put anything on my skin*
solved
xD
Yeah me neither, it's just the sunscreen *now*
I don't use sunscreen, not even in summer, in normal cases
This is purely for tattoo reasons
I always get asked by mom, why i don't wanna use body lotion my skin is so dry on my palms
Every time, my answer is "I can't stand it, i can't endure the feeling of it on my skin"
Meanwhile, me
Loving physical contact xd
That's different
Same, tho only with close people, i don't like strangers touching me xd

Az elej�n �gyis m�g az owlbear-ekkel harcolunk
*The what*
Majd k�rn�k egy �tbaigaz�t�st az el�z� sessionr�l xd
THE WHAT?
So jealous
A cucc amit odasz�ll�tottunk Westguard-hoz bevonzza az owlbear-eket valami�rt
Also, that stuff is highly explosive, so no sparks or fires allowed
Session was: K�rbehaj�ztuk az Archipelago szigeteit, nem l�ttunk Drake ottl�t�re utal� jeleket, �gyhogy vissszament�nk Makolfba, ott k�rdezt�k, hogy mizu. Nem sok, de megk�rdezt�k, hogy Westguard-hoz el tudn�nk-e sz�ll�tani ut�np�tl�st ebb�l-abb�l, azt elv�llaltuk, mert �gyis a d�li �b�l fel� haj�ztunk tov�bb, mivel ott szoktak tany�zni a flaming�k amik mutatt�k az utat Legendalhoz. Ott meg is tal�ltuk �ket, �s Wrssstkcalk ny�gvenyel�s seg�ts�g�vel megtudtuk az egyik Shrimp Lord-t�l, hogy az egyik kisebb flaming� Legendal, aki ebben az �llapot�ban nem is l�t minket. Papa v�g�l eml�kezett, hogy le tudja r�la venni az �tkot. Legendal kid�lt, de m�r eredeti alakj�ban van. Azut�n Westguard-ba �rt�nk ahol fogadtak minket, elkezdt�k kipakolni a rakom�nyt, Legendalt meg felvitt�k egy szob�ba, k�zben viszont meg�rkeztek az owlbear-ek, �gyhogy most vel�k harcolunk
Ezut�n Keyport-ba haj�zn�nk, hogy OnaOn�t megk�rj�k, gy�gy�tsa meg Papa l�b�t
Meg tal�n m�g a k�t meg�ll� k�z�tt r�n�zni a kia'iakra a Living Wall-n�l, hogy mi a helyzet
I see i see
Nice, thank you
Kuwe'i Makolfban r�k�rdezett volna hogy siker�lt-e glowing tattoo inket csin�lni a gomb�kb�l amit vitt�nk, ha volt r� neki ideje
Well, maybe not explosive but flammable
A combat m�r elkezd�d�tt am�gy?
Igen
H�nyadik k�rn�l tartunk?
Passz. Tal�n 2? 3?
Ah okay
That's enough for me
Thank you very much

btw, how close are to the level up again, <@282869456664002581>?
should we prep for the possibility that we have a lvl up in the middle of the session, or not a thing this time around~

<@618475228695232532> hhhm, I'm also heavily considering just taking `Grasping Vine`, as then I could do something with my darn bonus action (an additional 4d8 dmg, and a potential grapple each turn~)
idk XD
<:catcry_peasantversion:1052945999196344360>
grasping vines deal damage??
:OO
> You conjure a vine that sprouts from a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration.Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 Bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 30 feet toward the vine; if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a Grappled creature (no action required).As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine.
>  Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The number of creatures the vine can grapple increases by one for each spell slot level above 4.
ye, 4d8 Bludgeoning
oh wow
it does now
asszem r�gen nem sevzett
but yea, dat is ***really*** compelling
do that
you are the cc god in the party
im just the enchanter
egz emberen lesz majd vagy 5 spell
tbh I kinda gave up on half my CC options, cause we never fight on land, and the other half is useless in underwater combat XD
what spells do you have prepped rn?
well, I say never, this is basically the one expection

basically these
I have given up on `Spike Growth`, from lvl 3 till now, this current encounter would've been the only useful place for it~
and the rest I picked up cause of RP reasons, idk
�s ezek k�z�l melyik subclass spell?
yeah spike growth az m�r ilyen magas szinten nem mindig el�ny�s

basically these

and then these my cantrips~
> I have find familiar listed here too, cause I can't freely swap it on long rests either~
so which land usually are you?
Arid, cause Fireball goes brrr
and soon Bligth too
coolio
thanks to my `Natural Recovery` (see: pic), I can also cast it for free now
which like yea...
thats so much utility

<:gun3:1024086700068192266>
<:gun3:1024086700068192266>
ye
you either go full out on the offensive spells
or just full on cc or heal
like quickly taking down a single enemy with `Blight` I believe to be better value than anything else that I could bring to the table atm
but yea, if we are given information on where we'll fight/ what we are fighting, that obviously changes things
yes
the best healing is dmg
damage I kinda just value to be the most reliable otherwise
cause prior I had like 4 CC options, only to still ever only use `Entangle`, which like...
XD
bc concentration
ye
I can only concentrate on so many things at once
<:Unhingedcatoo:1154687007356899388>
yeah
try to get at least one conc spell on every level one supp and one offensive
or like switch it up
vagy igy
osszd be szintekre
don't think I understood that, come again?
you say that I should have an even spread of CC & Offensive spells?
yes
but yea, atm I kinda just have spells that I think are useful, take note of which are used in practice, and get rid of the ones that see 0 play
like `heat metal` and whatnot
wouldd've been great, it just flat out useless in this setting till now, lol

You conjure a vine that sprouts from a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration.Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 Bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 30 feet toward the vine; if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a Grappled creature (no action required).As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The number of creatures the vine can grapple increases by one for each spell slot level above 4.

"Redfield contains one of the few known portals in the Sunken Isles. During the reign of Skomm Fylker, his arcane experiments created a small portal that began spewing out otherworldly spirits. Their scourge was pushed back for some time by village islanders, until a portal to yet another world was ripped open by Skati, spewing out different spirits to combat the hordes. Now contained to Redfield by Ikolf wards, the two dwindling portals have gone mostly dormant since their last outbreak decades ago. Large defensive structures lie in ruins in this area, holding otherworldly weapons and spirits."

*Standing on the shore, Papa looks around, rather concerned, heavily weighing and contemplating their situation. He turns to look into the unknown fields of the isle and sighs, uneasy.* -To tell you the truth...I never thought I would ever have to get involved in my kin's affairs....But this is weirdly unnerving...

Ye we met an imp who was like: "Please, stop help us, the evil demon rebels wont stop hurting us, we want peace."
� So are they like... supposed to be bad and evil? Because this one in particular seemed like a nice guy.
*Kuwe'i asks as he steps behind Papa, nodding at the imp's direction.*
� I honestly don't know how I'm supposed to treat this whole situation.
*He shifts his weight to one leg, crossing his arms in front of his chest.*

*A curt answer for Kuwe'i.*
- With caution.
*And then she shifts her gaze to  Papa once again.*
- Will you be alright? *She tries to keep it a casual inquiry.*
*He looks back at Kuwei then back towards Redfield.* -Dont worry, Kuwei, I think all of us are a little perplexed at the moment. It is certainly making things more complicated...


*Quick, everyone, point fingers at someone* XD
*You can point at yourself*
!rank
-Hopefully... *Papa says with a reassuring smile.* -I am just a little concerned how the spirits might react to the sudden change in nature... *He clasps his necklace with eyes closed.* -We do not know how the influance of another plane affected this island and now that it is released....*A hint of concern peaks in his voice.* -It is hard to tell if this further tips the balance of the Isles... It has been decades. I wonder who is stronger...The soul of Hell or the Spirits of Makolf.... as for me, personally... *He rests his hand on Makas shoulder, tapping it twice.* -Do not fret. I hardly believe there will be anyone connected to my lineage, let alone happens to know me at all. My blood just feels tad more.... Hmmm, rushing. *His smiles lively.*
*She nods at the end of the cleric's words.*
- I think we are past having to measure the balance of things... The Star Breather, our creator wants us wiped... But I want the spirits to triumph if they remain on our side. *She closes her eyes for a few moments, shakes her head. The red fins on her head slightly quiver with the motion. She fixes her eyes on the tiefling.*
Since **you** know the most of these things, tell us about **all** the details of their habits, kinds, weapons, strengths and weaknesses. Anything concrete.

(Its those scenes where you wake up after a shipwreck and its the next day)
(Okay then)
*Each step is still a little wobbly as his head still feels whoozy after this massive accident, his whole body shook to the core. While walking, he can make out a group of seagulls, soaring above and gently but delibaretly landing in the sand, curiously looking for something new to eat, picking on the bodies ocassionally turning up on the shore. No humanoid life can be detected...yet. The weather is humid and the air clings to the skin. As Enwir moves along, searching for his valuables, he notices something more...gathered in the sand. Bodies.*
*If there is an upside, seagulls will be easy pickings for food with the use of his magic, that is if he even needs to resort to hunting them. He tries to recollect the course of the voyage to determine whether he got stranded on a derelict island or not. As he notices the water fowl gather around the scattered dead, he takes silent note of them. Not the first time he has seen ordinary people meet an untimely demise. 
In the earlier years of his career -If you can still consider his current wandering as a continuation of it-, when he was still serving as a paladin, when he still had holy approval from his deva, and that radiant light about him, he grieved over the losses he couldn't have prevented, but as time went on, and he cut himself off from his duties, everything he had, he learned to settle, give up trying to save everyone, or feel bad for failing in it. He monitors the beach one more time, calls out for the only other person who matters right now, who still might be alive. He cups his hands to his mouth, forming a cone.*
- Illigen!
*The yell comes out hoarse from his dry throat. He stands still and listens. If only these birds around him weren't so loud.*
*He catches sudden movement from the corner of his eye, from the pild of bodies, weirdly stacked on each other. Then a pained grunt and the seagulls fly away in panic.* -Hhhgnnnuugh....H-help... *A rasped, broken voicd of a man can be heard beneath the mangled and broken-up bodies. Enwir's stomach twists as his nostrils pick up the putred odor of the blood from the corpses marinated by the salty seawater.*
what?
(Get to eating)
I assume you got some early beta thing
(*Bone apple tea*)
(*putrid)
*He picks up the pace as he traces it to the source, but stops with caution as he gets within a certain range of the pile. He doesn't want to be ambushed by some mimicking undead again. Don't ask. He looks them over for any sign that they might be something of the sort. If he deems it safe, he summons his invisible butler to aid in freeing the person, tend to their wounds.*
Beats me
It's just different than it was yesterday
miben?
Volume slider is on the right now
And it's vertical
And the look of the hud also changed
I assume on pc, ye?
that probably won't stick, but you can give feedback as a beta group person
(You know, you could just edit it in the text itself)

I really hoping it won't stick, that sounds like a nightmare
the kind of straightforward planning that appeals to me. state your intention, give a timeline, this is pretty fucking neat, tbh
You guys are starting to convince me I need a card like this as well.
*Upon disassembling and twisting the bodies atop and out of each other, Enwir can notice the bodies were manually stacked upon one another as the mound looks too....piled... Upon further examination as the unseen servand does its task, the bodies have various holes and slashes which they drastically bled out from. Could have been the parts of the ship, puncuring and piercing their skin before washed upon the shore. The man stuck under the weight of the bodies breaths slowly and heavily and his heaving, maimed chest can be seen, after they toss the last body off of him. His face is covered with blood and his one intact eye franctically darting everywhere but at Enwir. His legs are broken beyond repair in a weirdly unnatural way. It is a miracle he still breaths.* -Hhhggg, hiiiii... agh. *He coughs blood and doesnt seem to focus. Enwir can recognise this man. He was the mate who pushed him and Illigen away, saving them from a similarly gruesome fate.* -Scales... fins....hurgh... *More blood pours out of his mouth as the words weakly roll down his lips.*
(Tudtam)
(What? Xd)
(Tudtam, hogy az a matr�z lesz az)
(XD im clishe)
No, Hikaru is the white boy
Xd
*He takes to one knee to be at eye level with the man in pain, gently placing his hands on the major wounds. He wishes to repay the debt with what limited healing powers he still has access to.*
- It is alright. Save your strength.
*He speaks in soft, hushing tones to soothe the injured sailor, to put him at ease if he makes a recovery, or grant him a calm, peaceful passing.*
True
I didn't remember his human form's skin color
I might have mixed him up with Satoru
*Saturation*
*The divine touch, Enwirs remaining godly strenght left on his desposal stops the severe bleeding of the wounds, yet as he could have figured, it wont be nearly enough to save the man's life. His eye bulges out wide and tainted by his own blood and the dirty seawater, it finally stop and stares into a single point, past Enwir as a long, pained grunt blows out of him.* -Hhhhrrrgghhh..... *With his last ounce of strenght, his finger twitches, pointing over the aasimars shoulder. He tries to open his mouth to speak once again but....all of a sudden something flies by Enwir, nicking his ear and it splits open the mans face, splashing blood and organs all over his clothes.*

*e*
(to be fair there is a pretty high chance I'm neurodivergent, so this might not work on "normal ppl")
*Sai arrives in the rain at the Noknov noble estate, carrying a bouquet of flowers. After she knocks, Orinala opens the door with a smile, glancing back at Tanathar, who�s complaining about the vest being too tight for the ball happening that night. She turns her gaze to the elf standing at the doorstep. A squint, as if something about Sai stirs recognition... then her smile fades, a trace of disgust creeping onto the corner of her mouth.*

\- Three months too late.
\- I just...
\- No. You don�t. If you�re interested why, the backyard�s to the left.

*The heavy door creaks shut. Through it, she hears the boy ask something.*

\- Who was it?
\- Just someone lost. She�ll be on her way now.
\- Kay. Can you come help?
*He has no time to process the loss as he reflexively jumps to his feet, steps forward and to the side, turning around with momentum to face whatever horror stands behind him, left hand to his focus, the other at the ready to signal the arcane gestures, evoke a spell for combat. If his enemy is up close, in his personal space, he might feel threatened enough to let loose his withering, tainted true form.*

*He chuckles at the half-eyed rangers question. His smile is clean and his perfectly chisled jawline almost shines in the forest gloom as sunligjt touches his face, illuminating his silver flow.* -Think of me as a...private agent. *He bows eloquently, his arm crossed around his chest.* -Is there anything I can be of service for you?

He also met with the twins
*The girl eyes her up and down with a smirk but shakes her head a little at the cocky man.*
\- Thank you but no need right now, the my brother, the Lord's in town. We'll manage, but feel free to indulge in what's left of the party. The main event may be over as of now, but food's still on the table for everyone visiting. Sun's setting soon, if you need we are offering tents for the passerbys. *She opens her arms towards the small crowds still dancing to a bard's quiet melody.*
*He spins around and at first there is nothing his eyes catch infront of him, only a distant rustle of the beachgrass atop a sandy hill captures his attention. Soon enough, finned and scaly humanoid creatures emerge from behind the hills, holding tridans and spears in one hand and makeshift nets in the other, hissing and gurgling maliciously at the aasimar as they spread around him after realising that they missed their target. Their eyes are black pearls of savage emptyness, they carry the humid scent of rotten fish and they look positively wet and slippery trying to spread around the aasimar, measuring their steps carefully. There is 3 of them...Sahuagin, demonic creatures of the dark depths.*
(Enwir has brain hair and eye jelly in his mouth.)
DiceGod reporting on the trials XD
*Thank you for keeping us up to date on these important matters*
-It would be my honor and I greatly appreciate your offer. Id be bold enough to accept if that is alright. I feel weary after traveling on horseback for so long. Pray tell, what was this festival about, as it appears that I have missed the celebrations?
How? XD
\- 'Twas for the Lord's day of birth. He rarely visits from his long journeys and sometimes not even the gods know where he's off to.
*She holds a hand out for the horse's lead.*
\- We'll brush and feed the stallion of yours while you relax friend. Feel yourself at home for us, will you?
(You can take my stallion any time)
-Oh dont mind if I do. *He bows again, not so low this time and he is off to look around.*
(You can freestyle it. Some are dancing, some drinking and eating. Leoris is not here)
*He spits with difficulty from the lack of saliva, holds himself back to not convulse, bend over and vomit out the grime that got launched into his mouth, which would put him at a great disadvantage right now, and starts with an eldritch blast that splits two (or three) ways. He makes an effort to keep track of the three fiends. Waits for them to get in close enough range so that he can maximize the effectiveness of his frightening presence when finally unleashed.*

angered the God of the Dead
wtf is this TREX ability
*He evades to the best of his ability, his old and somewhat rusted melee combatant reflexes flaring up, balanced with magical offense every now and then until the timing's just right. In that moment the dark, ethereal, elongated skeletal wings of a great bird "rip out" from his back, emerging like  scythes ready for harvest. The usually pale gray, marble veins on his skin flood stark black, running out from his eyes like spilled ink, matching the gaunt, absence-of-light colored limbs he just sprouted. All color drains from the rest of his complexion, contrasting sickly white sheet with the shadowy trails. The warm beach air around him turns to a blood-curdling chill, like the abrupt, bitter arrival of early winter, which will not spare anything.*
HE FUCKING DISPELLED MY HIGHEST LEVEL SPELL SLOT I USED
*A walk in the park*
You think? XD
How did you manage that?
he already felt like he needs to summon 6 skeletal trexes as our **9th** wave of enemies
***AND*** he dispelled my highest level spell
xD
we asked if we could leave his city xD
<@875753704685436938> this was in your name
(I'm a caster xD)
(if you don't feel like duking it out between them, we might as well drop the rp honestly. No need to push it if you're not into it.)

I don't mind if everyone else is fine with it

El�bb meg gondolom nem kezdhetn�nk
You can still isles on vacation tho
Am�g j�tszatok mi s�t�get�nk valamit
But thats vacation
I'd rather be in the moment
Fair fair. I'm just saying that being away for 3 hours isn't the end of the world.
But game comfort would also suck on phone and tablet
Okay nvm

I have aquired a few options for oneshots. Kiv�ncsi vagyok melyik t�ma �rdekeln� a csapatot, nehogy olyan d�lut�ni programmal k�sz�ljek ami valakinek nem tetszene.
1 - I.S.T.A.R. Facilities: Working for the Zentharim to get one of their training facilities operational once again.
2 - How to not Host a Murder: A murder mistery for woefully unprerpared adventurers
3 - Winger's Crest: The Winter King's here and he checked his list twice, he doesn't care if you're naughty or nice.

(all of them 6-7th level, 3-4 hour oneshots for a single afternoon)
<@&1307302474109161505> seems like cs�t�rt�k lesz a session napja.

Akkor lesz fuvar a nyaral�sra? <@520697326679883808>
Mert akkor a csapat m�sik fel�t apu tudja vinni
I'll make an 11th character. Alright xD
For once i wanna play the 5.5e monk xD
Uuuuh
Alrighty xD
We could go 5.5e sure
Oh you were calculating with 5e?
If that's more comfortable for you, we can go 5e
Well the adventure was written in 5e but I don't think too much has changed
I hope xD
If you wanna be sure it goes well, we can stay in 5e xD
Depends
I'm fine with both
Depends how much options u peeps want with characters
I'll be fine with any, i'm not gonna bitch about my oneshot character not having a personalized subclass and subrace with special snowflake background elements xD
As DM to DM: 5.5e character power budget almost double compared to 5e. Boost HP of enemies by a lot or we're gonna steamroll.
Maybe.
I'm thinking caster. Cleric or sorcerer
So we goin 5.5? XD
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
Sure. I'm fine with both. 5.5 is a bit harder on you, but if you feel like you'll manage, we can.
Was thinking the same XD
Ohno xdd
So many monks xD
Oh, hmmm xDDD
Can play barn
BARN
Was thinking martial for the oneshot
XD. I laughed so hard when I saw that xD
The barn barb, called HAYden
I'll only accept a barn barb if they are amisg
XD
El�z�leg changeling cleric-et vittem ugyanerre
Hmm. I'll let you guys decide between cleric and sorci for me. I'm open to both, not leaning to either one of 'em
Imma need to brush up on 5.5 rules xdd
It's not a lot honestly :D it was quick and easy to get used to it
Tho i'm speaking of the player side
Player side it's cleaner. On DM side it's almost the same. Only a few rules changes
Gud gud
Hayden Barnes
Bonus points if he's a mounted combatant with a horse

I'll be cleric. Haven't been the support in a while
When u last was, u were the dps and then got killed
XD
? O.o
CoS
The ex wizard
Grave(?) Cleric
Ooooh yeah. Well sorry that I had better damage as a support than you guys. That campaign was made for clerics xD
XDDD
But that flesh golem oneshot was amazing
Crit
Guiding bolt with bonus double damage invoc
That was a legendary moment

Kay Dicey xd
Na irtam a sz�ll�snak, we shall see
Soo
The pdf says that Six Faces of Death is a dark fantasy adventure
I have
Uuuuu
a vastly different opinion xDDD
<:CyberPog:610129563254521875>
Depends on how you run it. XD
If it is dark fantasy then it is a very funny one xD
One could play CoS as a joke campaign as well
No i mean the adventure makes sure that it is kinda funny xD
Xd
"* features a lot of humor that you can use to lighten
the overall dark tone*"
<:point:951578243415302235>
I love it xD
I guess dark humor counts? xd.
"To run a particularly dangerous version of the adventure,
use pregenerated characters and start the adventure with a
shipwreck that leaves the party stranded with no preparation"
xDDD
*Thank u game, very cool*
it is an adventure btw
Hogy legyenek az emberek a kocsikban? Bence, �gi, meg Nika apud�kkal, mi meg Danival Mikl�ssal?
so lil onger
11-13 lvl
I read degenerated characters XD
Sounds good to me
xDD
*that would certainly not help*
Ye that works
T�l�lj�k
*Mondta, majd tpk lett az els� encounterb�l*
Mekkora is a kocsija?
Mert n�lunk az egyetlen baj az az hogy kicsi a csomagtart�
Sz�val lehet �lbe kell vinni a cuccot xdd
Norm�lis Peugeot
Csomagtart� pretty decent
Akkor lehet j� lenne ha ti vinn�tek m�g egy embert xd
Ok�
Nik�t akkor
Some maybe weird but important things imma need before the game
Character alignment
All six stats
And a place dear to the character, somewhere they'd like to visit or yearn towards
Doesn't have to be specific just
A type of place they like
Like a cottage, an oasis, a beautiful garden, etc
Also a general desire they might have
Will this be integrated into our world?
*Depends*
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
*Well, whom I'd bring also depends on that*
The thing is
It can end in big catastrophe xDD
We wanna play in Ouria?
Cause I was thinking faerun, starting from Waterdeep but we can play in Ouria
Nem �gy �rtettem. Am�gyis n�lunk FR az m�r integr�lva van
OotA, meg ilyenek �ltal
Fair
We can integrate it sure
Ink�bb csak annyi, hogy a k�vetkezm�nyeit bevessz�k-e a k�nonba
Whatever is more comfy for you guys xdd
Mert ha helyet kap az id�vonalon, akkor lehet azt a karaktert nem tudn�m vinni m�shov�. Le lenne r�gz�tve
Fair
Idk
I think Imma just bring someone inconsequential
Keep it simple
Alrighty
It's gonna be a lil longer tho so u might have time to flash it out somewhat
Ja, eml�kszem m�g anno
<:point:951578243415302235>
So anyway
Please send these to me whenever yall ready
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
Akkor 5.5 yes?
Yea
For sure
I love big stuff happening in main continuity
It bring interesting things further down the line for other DMs
*aaaaaaaaa*
I need it
All the kitart�st
Majd el�z� nap �rj, hogy mikor �r be a buszod, vagy a vonatod
Oksa, szerintem n�zek majd valami buszt ami ilyen 13:15 k�r�lre be�r
Vagy olyan 13:30ra
We'll see
But bus is definitely more comfortable for me
De csak ide VPig kell bej�jjek, nem?
Mondjuk, ha sok lesz a cuccom lehet anyu behoz
Ye
Ja, onnant�l felvesz�nk, csak akkor el�sz�r �rted menn�nk, azt�n vissza ide Dani�rt, �s onnan induln�nk
Ut�na gondolom egyb�l haza is m�sz
Power through, legend
I'm thinking about Leor potentially
Ehh, lehet m�g be kell majd mennem dolgozni xDD
-# Who was Leor? I don't remember
Aasimar paladin
The Solar fanboy. Ramsey's boyf
Wait
Then my boy would get anchored too because he met him in an rp
But then again, I guess we can put this oneshot near ToA
And then it'll all work out
*Fucking time table*
Minor issues can be ignored
*Wibbly wobbly timey wimey*
We do delete some characters from places. It's not hard set in stone cuz with time our ideas change
Yeah, but like I said, they met and talked before and I did integrate that meeting into my char
OH REALLY
So, it would be kinda if strange if now they'd be hundreds of years apart
Leor is pretty long lived. It should be fine.
Same
He is elf aasimar from what I remember
Oh, okay
*Me with the tiefling Melanie*
Yupp
Then no need to care for real cause he'll live for like 900 years XD
Exactly. Go nuts \:D
Though he met him when he still was with Archie, but eh, that could also be whenever in his long lifespan
It was pretty early for Leor. But he's just an idea.
*Max id�n �t t�rt�n� tal�lkoz�sok ad�dtak* XD
*Time shenanigans*
*The fabric of the universe got tangled*
*Or it was another aasimar paladin named Leor, who had an albino kenki companion for some time and then met up with a girl who had metal prosthetics*
I'm not even sure Nika kept them together after she brought Ramsey to TBOR
So in my head the whole rp could be considered outside of canon. Old RPs fall behind new at table games for me.
But that is only my opinion.
Well, I wanted to keep it because it is always nice to give some hints about earlier meetings and stories. Feels more lived in
But I can do without it if every character is spread across the timelines
I don't remember when tbor is set compared to the rp.
Bruh xd
Oh fuck. Kitart�st
I can just change the details so it does not concern your characters anymore
Keep it vague enough
Cuz you wanted your character from there?
I considered it for a moment, but like I said, I wanna keep it simple for this oneshot
Probably bringing a barb
A character I never used anywhere or a newly created one

XD
*Just take all those simultaneously emerging thoughts, open your mouth, and let your tongue mix it for you in the most jagged, least understandable way... when it can even be trusted not to trip over itslef*
Not a one shot
An adventure
Still short but ye xs
*Oneshort(adventure)* XD
Sure xDD
Flawless logic honestly
*Thank you. I pride myself on my impeccable rationality*
Light domain cleric Leor it is.
I will be the healer
Who heals by killing everything around us with fireball
<:fireElmo:1353867130247974914>
Imma probably be a dragonborn, or a tiefling
Haven't played those yet
HMM
Maybe I can use an older character concept for my dragonborn
Imma... play something xD
Monke is the only fixed thing for me

Na
*Egy pillanatra nem �rtettem mi�rt hordasz Fedor�t meg VR szettet, ja, meg a cip�kollekci�t honnan szalajtottad* XD
M�gis tudn�k rendesen lenni szerintem
Hek yeah
Im actually gonna throw up

XD

Stat oszt�s sima point buy right? Starting equipment and money? (Magic items? <:foog:1270803561382543458>)

Sz�val nem k�l�n szob�ban vagykk
Hhh
De majd megl�tjuk
|| pov: kevin on vrchat ||
point buy is a yes
*hmmmm monay and equipment*
Very hmm

maybe like a 1k gp and either three uncommon or one uncommon and one rare item
(or common if you'd like)

Also some basic backstory is enough

Now for some hooks
Upon the arrival of the strange island characters could've ran into this lovely poster, rallying adventurers to Waterdeep's port

Or by knowing the lovely fellow on it, Ruk the Sightless, a ranger who sails the coast protecting the seas around it with his ship the Old Pilgrim
Another way to get into this mess
is by knowing one of Waterdeep's mages, Sladek the Blue, a water genasi mage who is really into geology and went to explore the new island with a small crew
*he surprisingly went missing*
shocker i know
A quick sketch i made of him

Watchful Order
of Magists and Protectors of Waterdeep are also looking for him and are willing to pay a heafty sum to those who bring him back alive
with his stuff
or dead
with his stuff

-# He pretty
*He is now potentially dying on an unknown strange island* <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
*I can fix him*
-# (Even if he's a puzzle now. Literally in pieces)
*You don't even know*
<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
*I don't*
*But I will eventually*
*Hopefully*
Can I get trauma?
Potentially xD
*Very likely*
*Don't be afraid of giving me trauma*
*I adore a good character development*
-# *Whichever way it may develop*

One on your leg?
Same style but with... Koi fishes?
J�l eml�kszem?
Yes, and now i want one on my right lower arm too
Yes, big koi fish on the side and bamboos growing up from the bottom
(Koi fish swimming upwards is a symbol of change, the koi changing into a dragon (the dragon on my arm))
(:3333)
Alkarodon meg dunno. K�gy�? That's another one that they illustrate a lot. Red panda cuz you find them cute xD
I was thinking of either a (asian style) traditionally illustrated crane, or a tiger, or yes a red panda i was actually thinking about that
Or idk, lehet m�g �t-design-olom hogy bamboo helyett valami vizi n�v�nyzet, ha m�r v�zben �sz� koi hal lesz
Azt�n a bamboo meg �tker�l alkarra a crane mell�
We'll see :3333
(Thank you DiceGod)
Vagy l�bsz�ron a koi ami �szik felfele a h�n�rral, combon meg a crane a v�z parton n�v� bambjszban
Vad�szik a k�ts�g
Hmmm no i think i wanna keep the koi fish on the upper, outer thigh
Akkor nincs mit tenni
Az oldaladon lesz a crane a bambusszal, hogy a v�z f�l�tt legyen

*Dragonborn arrives with a warhammer, a double greataxe, and a 2handed mace.*
-so which one you wanted? Xd
<@282869456664002581> i swear DiceGod became sentient
Oh wait wha. I'm still Grei?

Yes
Ideally a martial character should have every damage type available in their arsenal
That should be a baseline
There's only the three XD
*Always have been*

*Forever Grei*
I keep a little dirt under my pillow for the dirt man
*Good*
*Don't let it get too dusty. Keep it moisturized*
In case he comes to town
*But also don't let it be too soggy like mud*
*That's for the mud man*
Can you get a bludgeoning weapon as well? Are there any finesse bludgeoning weapons?
Well I can't see any so you're wrong
Light hammer. Not finesse, but light
So I should be able to use it
It can be thrown too
But no sneak attack with that one T-T
Damage is pathetic
�gy eml�keztem az light trait-es fegyvereken is m�k�dik, de lehet rosszul eml�kszem
Well, yeah, no
Light weapon doesn't count, only finesse
Still, I'll have bludgeoning as an option. A very poor one, but an option nonetheless
Why we need bludgeoning tho?
At that point I'll just use my breath weapon. Your mail won't stop me from poisoning your ass
Dani has a secret plan
I can make bludgeoning extra spicy.
Also it's nice to have a wider selection of damage types
I see xdd
Touch the candles and I kill u <:zorablush:1021403403768844308> <:gun:1024082649054191626>

*The sahuagi flee in terror as soon as the otherwordly wings unfurl from Enwir's back and they scatter to the wind, throwing their weapons away. They do not seem to put up with this ungodly mindfuck the aasimar unleashed on them. His move was effective but he still feels wet and now reeks of innards and blood.*
*Looking around after this fiendish encounter, he still cannot find anyone other then himself on the wrecked shore.*
(Hunt for pearls(
(*I would, but my lungs and ears are not trained for that*)
(Start a Forest game)



*He watches them flee with sour satisfaction as his shadowy wings retract and vanish. He stands still, awaiting if there will be another round of combat, but as the seconds pass he relaxes his posture, pulls his hand clear of the brooch and lets it hang next to his hip. After his pulse climbs down a notch, pain from newly acquired cuts and bruises leaks into his flesh, forces him to tremble for a good bit. This thin sleepwear he's stuck in doesn't provide adequate protection from the weather, let alone weaponry. He doesn't even have access to his healing powers for the rest of the day, and his medical kit was stored in his backpack. The same backpack that Omen was supposed to fetch for him, but now might have ended up at the bottom of the sea along with the rest of his belongings, the ship,... hopefully sparing Illigen. Until he hasn't seen his cold, motionless body and hasn't waited and confirmed that he indeed is not feigning death through some magical means, he'd rather believe he is out there somewhere further up or down the beach, looking for him as well. If he himself made it unconsciously to the shore, the sea gracious enough to let that happen, then the changeling should have been granted with the same courtesy. Besides, he was always resourceful and smart, skilled, fast,... flexible... Not the time and place, he reminds himself as he stirs from the inflow of pleasant memories. He stays put just a little while longer, pressing the lips of his wounds together, stopping the bleeding. Only thing he can do for himself right now, then walk and walk in one direction until some substantial find comes up.*
(Lips of his wounds? Pussy aches?)
(You know what?)
(Can i leave the server?)
(I knew you would say something like that, and I still wrote that XD)
(WALK IN ONE DIRECTION?)
(Originally it was mouths)
https://tenor.com/view/one-direction-dance-gif-21423146
(XD)
(Enwir creates a boyband)
(Lead singer btw)
(He can sing. He's fairly good at it)
(He would be great as a solo indie artist tbh)
(He is a solo fiendish warlock XD)
(Good Cha, good Int, okay Str, average Wis, and Con and Dex are whatever is left)
*He also cleans himself up, again.*
*Continuing his perilous walk on the wet and musky beach, Enwir can feel weariness taking over his mind. The chaotic and tragical events of last night heavily weigh on his head making him groggy and down trotten. In addition, the absence of his trusted traveling companion further saps the life and confidance from his heart. The aasimar starts feeling desperate, hungry and tired after what feels like an hour walking in the grey sand. Suddenly, he steps on something. Lifting his leg he can see a rotten, torn apart carcasse of a dead fish, its slimy scales sticking to the bottom of his boot, drawing a grimey string of goo with it. It smells foul, yet it should not be as overwhelming given it is a single head of a dead fish. Upon looking up, his vision seems to blurr...Enwir has to focus for a second to make out whats infront of him. Once his eyes dialet properly, he can see dozens of similarly smothered fish in the sand scattered all around, their dead, pearly eyes stare into nothingness up the skies, like pleading penatents of a false god, starved for blessing, their silent prayers spill from their agaped mouthes.*
*In the far distance on a tainted, green boulder he can see a form of a figure.*
(Wanna go to a waterpark?)
https://youtube.com/shorts/8jaQ6_hB_iM?si=ensZuGS3FqyJvaUn
*As always in these desperate situations, he calls upon acting and improv skills fit for the most prestigious waterdavian theaters' plays to mask any visible discomfort in visage and body language, not portray his of forgetfulness and confusion about which part of the script should be recited next in front of the crowd. The aasimar puts on a brave face, or at least a measured one, combines it with a precisely raised, even voice, which calls out to the shape.*
- Who might you be up there?
*He doesn't step between the great, gaping, dead-eyed fish heads that give him goosebumps. He doesn't want to join the ranks of these mind-numbed mockeries of church goers. Not that he went to any public church to behold such crowded gatherings. The Anla� family estate does however house a decent sized private chapel in its quite spacious back gardens. This beautifully decorated building is also an accesspoint to a vast underground crypt where his ancestors and siblings rest. They often attended sermons together in that chapel, and at the behest of his mother and father he prayed regularly and stayed true to tenets of their faith to make them proud, always obeying their asks to live up to their expectations, even if they were a far cry from his own wants and dreams. He remembers, after each attendance at the chapel, they would leave him for a few minutes under guard supervision to descend on those steps -flowers clasped in his mother's hands, his father's arm interwoven with hers-, into those cold, dimly lit chambers, just the two of them. Those few glimpses of them, stricken with grief never healing, only softening with time, when they thought he wasn't looking had pained him enough never to bring up the subject, although in later years he more or less put the pieces of the sad tale together from context clues and what was evident.*
*He really could've done without this horrible recollection, and the need to cut away from it spits him back into his current predicament with a cold shiver of shame, but not yet regret.*
(The fuck is this random exposition? Xd)
(Thats really not what i expected xd)
(Man is delirious apparently)
(How did he lose his soul btw?)
(You set up some surreal fish church scenery and him maybe beginning to hallucinate, so I took that XD)
(I wanted to sprinkle it into the rp, when it becomes relevant)
(De ha tudnod kell, vagy tudni akarod, akkor le�rom �gy, nagy vonalakban)
(�rd le nekem k�l�n)
(Pls)
XD
(Am�gy az alak j� messze van)
(Nem baj. *�gyis csak halulu* XD)
(*Average "european" nobleman steps out into sunshine for an hour, starts hallucinating batshit crazy stuff*)
(*Illigen meg ez alatt a p�r �ra, vagy nap alatt halfej szekt�t alap�tott* XD)
*There is eerieness clinging in the air and almost as if it became more moist and heavy, warm and humid, thick and touchable. His head spins almost losing his balance, his feet sinking into the wet sand nearly making him slip and stumble into the phlemish mud that is mixed with the stenching slime of the fish heads. Almost simultaniously a loud pan scraping noice rings ears as the downward, puckered lips of the fish all start talking at once.* -I can help you find who you seek... *The cacophony of almost shreeking voices feel like his whole cadaver is rattling with force, making it unbearable in his situation, yet it sinks deeper and deeper, piercing into his brain, planting it inside.* -You need help....I am the only who can.... *The voices die down with a gutteral gargle and the sudden silence is maddening all of a sudden.*
*Is he dying? Could he still be at sea, drowning? This **must be** a fever dream of his air deprived mind. A dream... like the ones Ralmoroth gives him when he underperforms in his obligations. Sometimes they start out calm, peaceful, even pleasurable every now and then, and at the snap of a finger they are twisted, rotted down into something perverse and painful, filled with images and scenes that should never be, or things that were and were done by him. Punishments were varied, and from time to time she spared him. Kept the intervals random enough, kept him guessing, unsure, paranoid when the next one would find him in his sleep, and when it did, he would wake up clawing around himself, soaking through his sheets from all the stress, but never screaming. Maybe some small noises of discomfort left his mouth, but she would never want anyone from the outside world to interfere. Better if he's alone and not heard, no one to comfort him. Not that he wished for anyone to behold him in that pitifilul state. He preferred to keep others out of his hair in most matters, hold onto as much dignity as he could still get away with. No, this couldn't be one of her nightmare playgrounds. For all those passing seasons, he never could even grasp the possibility, the inkling that those were only the figments of his resting mind. They always felt real to him. Right now, he tries to launch himself back from the fish head he first came across, but the mixture of all these sensory effects, the thirst and hunger, the vertigo, the ringing voices, they all work together to pull his body down into that slick, slimy grease, into the soil, and it seemingly works until he so nearly falls face first. Watching it in slowed time sensation, witnessing how close the grime festered ground is to his being, as if taken offense from some disgust he cultivated, he is darted awake enough to try and spring up, even if it's the last miserable thing he'll ever do, he'll rush to the figure in the distance.*

*Mustering all his strenght, he hurries a fast as he can despite the restraining shackles of the supping sand clinging to his feet with every step he takes. On his way, he can hear the gawping sorrow of the fish heads paving his way closer to the mysterious figure. Enwir can finally see it. A wet, seaweed and kelp covered individual, reeking of rotting fish and spoiled water. The young warlock cant make out the creatures complexions but can only hear its raspy and ragged breathing and its pallid yellow skinned arm with patches of green, slimy scales and bony protrusions, reaching out for Enwir.* -Oh you unfortunate wrech. You little lost seasnail... *Its voice is the same as of the fisheads, but its thankfully coming from one dierection now; from under the seakelp.* -How does.... *It lets out a hateful and raspy, shallow sigh.* -Granma can help you, oh I think I know how, my beautiful seashell.

Good job dear
*What sits before him is most certainly a sea hag, especially considering when it calls itself granma, and the fish heads are likely her past victims, turned into some fishmarket graveyard. He straightens in posture, signaling that he still has will and some fight in him even in his castaway condition. He makes a bow from above neck as a polite greeting, since there's no way he's going to kiss her hand, but it doesn't pay to get on her bad side. A courteous smile hangs on his parched lips while he is addressing the witch in calmer, although dry tones.*
- Your pitying is better used elsewhere, my good lady. As for your aid; I am sure you are aware, I already have ample *help* at my disposal and nothing much to offer in turn for your generous offer.

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving owers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.
 The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

*What this be?*
DC azt jelzi nekem, hogy �rsz, Endi. That's a lot of typing
*The Psionic Lord has fallen a year ago, festivities are ongoing to celebrate the end of the Bloodburn. Everyone is returning to their everyday lives except you. You are preparing to confront Vorrakstyr, as of yet, it is invulnerable, but once the psionic prison fully fades you have to be ready to strike while it is still weakened from ages of slumber.*

*The island, which turned out to be the greatwyrm itself, has been evacuated, most of Nagakaburous' followers now reside in a new village along the river south of Mulandir, with Omylia paying frequent visits to Oriolus in the city. Together exploring whatever was left of Mulandir, even though the Nexus network is gone.*

*The great teahouse is finally built, with Yria spending most of her time there serving customers and preparing for the kid, as they are expected in a few months. While Scorpio has been trying to recollect any memories of the past to learn more about this enemy as well as hunt down "smaller" dragons that have been causing trouble, sensing that the balance of power in the world is about to shift.*

*While Oriolus keeps a close eye on him Grei finds moments to sneak out on "supply missions" with the Umbra, trying to gather up any and all equipment that could be used effectively against such a powerful dragon and maybe even more importantly against something that is also such a powerful* ***spellcaster***.

*Arden got lost deep in research and experimentation, trying to empower and advance his already wide range of powers. Academies from all around the continent has been lending their aid both to Oriolus' and Arden's research.*

||@everyone||
(it was a lot of thinking more like)
it will only ping ppl who are in the channel
1. We'll need to find a day or two or three to brawl this out
2. You are level 16, levelup your old character
3. Brainstorm what you guys will want to learn about this threat, what kind of advantages you are looking to gain for the fight
3.1. You'll need anything you can gather
3.2. Allies are probably more reliability than help, look to empower yourselves
4. You can probably get any non-magical item, and even *most* magical ones too, although it might take quite a lot to find something truly special

No
Kibaszottul szarul �rezn� mag�t v�gig
K�zel tizede sem az ereje b�rmelyik�t�k�hez k�pest
Felszintezni meg extra cuccokat adni neki id�ig�nyes lenne
�s nem vagyok hajland� se 40 extra k�pess�get kital�lni jeki se bekock�ztatni a moodswingj�t
Sz�val sry de marad a 4es csapat
*Damn.* Arden "wanted" to bring him along for this
As much as anyone wants their loved ones to face world ending dangers
J�l van
It's up to us then
To be fair, I was very invested. If I can manage to be that, I can usually recall things pretty well

To this day I still know what's reposted in shitposting
Sz�val akkor a sheet-ek �jra el�rhet�ek

Alright
Majd �t�rom a cuccokat, de el�sz�r �gi oneshort(adventure)-j�re k�ne m�g k�sz�lni
*Could I grapple the island sized dragon with my vines?* XD
Extra j� gy�gyitalok nem lenn�nek rosszak. Ha Scorpio �gyis megy kisebb s�rk�nyokat gyakni *hobbib�l*, akkor megk�ri, hogy hozzon neki a v�r�kb�l
Those damage resi healing potions were good
Az �j verzi� hogy �ll? Mert ha m�r eg�sz j�l, akkor k�rn�k a The Six Faces of Death-hez is

I'm not saying that

You have qualities that benefits the herd, but being a protector is not one of them.

Reminds me of a coversation I had with my boss earlier...
*Boss looking at trees the company is tasked to cut*: "Igen, azt a faszommal is kid�nt�m, azt lankadt fasszal, azt [�]"
XD
This is 100% true and happened

# THAT'S ONE STRONG DICK YOU'VE GOT THERE
The conversation happened, i'm sorry i should've clarified :'D
I know I'm just pulling your leg
-# i hope it's just a leg after this converastion tho
U ain't pulling no leg of mine, it's still intact

<:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
Can I have a pistol?
Ingame
XD
I was about to ask what you mean xD
Hmmm
Great question
My dad had a pistol irl. Dunno if we still have it
I don't think a pistol would fit this game
I mean this adventure
Okay
And I don't think they'd give you a gun xDD
Yeah, probably not XD
Tho you'll get a weapon for sure so
*But I'm sure he would have asked anyway*
XD
Oh ye
Idk maybe they would, but it don't really fit the adventure feel
*hmm*
*Arden at golden feather Oriolus: My baby angel whom I offer my life to

*Indeed*
<:highgrei:1237378027210674256>
*Arden at Grei: I love a man who can just actually kill me*
Nah, he did not like that at all
I only asked because I am reusing my other rogue sheet as a base to speed up the process, and that has a pistol, so I asked just in case whether I should delete that or not
Ye I think no to pistol
Ye, we skip this week sry
<@&1209957580164702270>
Anna, this is an exceptional skill you should find a way to exploit
This'll be a very interesting combat, lot of tactical element and will need a good strategical approach, in short, u guys won't be fighting a single token I put on the field, still debating in myself how exactly I want to make it work
I have two main ideas at the moment, we'll see which I go with
Good enough I'd say, nincs dicegodra k�tve viszont
Az a r�sze nem g�z. �gyis irl j�tszan�nk a SFoD-t
A grapple k�rd�sre m�g annyit, hogy ha azzal megyek, hogy a s�rk�ny r�szei mind k�l�n tokenek, akkor egy-egy r�szt k�l�n lehet le tudsz fogni, pl az egyik sz�rny maga egy gargantuan token
Yria has 0 intentions of coming, she understands that she'd be more of a drawback
I'd love to use DiceGod again for my rolls tho
Am fine with the 5.x sheets
Sure
Good thing she doesn't wanna come <:scorpioemotionaldamage:1237447864758566992> i don't want her accidentally killed :'D
The old sheets will be used still, you can just still set them
She doesn't want to come and nobody wants her to come on this either
It's just perfect <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
"Yo, u ain't coming to this one i hope u get tha-"
"I'd never, hells, now fuck off"
"Perfect, now stay safe"
XDDDD
*Such affectionate language in the Scorpio household* XD
XDDD
*I love you, bitch. I ain't never gonna stop loving you, biiiitch*
XDDDDDD
However you also know Yria enough to know she's also not gonna just *not do anything* even if she is not coming
Oh of course I know
That's why Scorpio would probably make her swear she'd do NOTHING that puts her in ANY KIND AND LEVEL of danger
I think she gets it already
And Scorpio will never not tell these to her
Even if she knows
He's an overprotective boi
"I'm in danger by simply existing at the same time as Vorrakstyr, can't promise something that would already be broken"
Especially now that she's pregananant
Yepp, that sounds like an Yria response
XD
"You know what I mean!"
XDDD
"I do, don't worry, I'll most probably be safe, and I'm not leaving Mulandir"
(I will also borrow back Luan from her for this event)
Yep

Don't wanna end up as

M�r k�tszer meghalt. Nem kell a szent h�roms�g XD
Yeah xD
*I didn't get my body back to turn into crisps on the spot*
Funny, but that's almost exactly what happened to him btw xD
He got his body *before* that big firewielder fight, he did become a little bit fish-and-chips at some parts on his body xDDD
Yeah
Then he got his arm torn off
He's a lil reckless for sure xD
I *just* got torched and executed by a burning greataxe
I did drink some of their blood afterwards tho, so I guess that makes us even XD
XDDDDD
*I guess it's time to reattune to that cursed armor that makes me go insane every full moon*
Why not look for a new armor with similar magical abilities?
Maybe, but not right now
I am putting together my rogue for SFoD
Yeah, fair enough

**What was the greatest decision or turning point in your character's life?**

**What is something your character wishes thesy could change about themselves?**

**What is your character's signature posession of physical trait?**
Also. Since we are going to play in The Outlanda (Te epicenter of the multiverse the D&D universe) your character can be anyone. They can come from any other dimension, universe, realm or plane that is connected to the D&D multiverse.
first uhm
tell us these things
hogy hol j�tsz�dik, mi�rt vagyunk kalandorok, mi�rt lett�nk h�rtelen egy csapat etc
"what is the reason for the adventure" basically
oh yeah no worries....you dont know. XD
fuck this cat
okay sz�val akkor ha csin�lok egy karit akinek egyetlen l�teleme �s c�lja az hogy merchantokat raboljon �s a n�pnek adja a p�nzt az m�k�dik?
�s egy depressed �regember is m�k�dik akinek az �lete m�r egy�ltal�n nem �rdekli, csak �gy elvan is m�k�dik?
�rted :D
kell valami guidance hogy a csapat m�k�dj�n valamennyire xD
H�t a karaktert �gy csin�lod meg ahogy szeretn�d, de l�nyeg�ben egy csapat vagytok akik m�r dolgoztak egy�tt, kalandorok a multiverzumban. Sigil r�sze vagytok, hogy azon bel�l melyik deimnzi�b�l j�ttetek mit csin�ltatok miel�tt a City of Doors-ba j�ttetek, az r�tok van b�zva. A probl�ma ott kezd�dik, hogy szinte alig vannak eml�keitek a multatokr�l bele�rtve a neveteket. Van n�mi fogalmatok arr�l, hogy miket tudtok, de valahogy semmi sem �rz�dik hely�nval�nak.
(Rem�lem az �gy m�r t�bbet seg�t)
k�t abolute kezd� van itt
soha nem hallottak Sigilr�l meg ilyesmi arra legy�l k�szen :D
tudom
most ez nekem is eszembe jutott, de hey
you know nothing XD
sure thing
So basically its an intro/reintro to the world
<@332925665424834560> <@199532516426776576> 
milyen klasszokat hoztok? csak hogy kit�ltsem azt ami marad
�gy egy brief background ok�snak kell lenni, plusz nyugodtan olvassgassatok dolgokat, de persze ha meg akarjatok konnyteni a dolgotok
mindenki Torilr�l j�tt XD
you just somehow became multideimensonal adventurars.
(t�bbieknek eml�t�s: Toril a "standard" vil�g ahol alapb�l j�tszunk �ltal�ban)
you had a past together as a team but now nothing seems to click
yes. Forgotten Realms
ah sz�val �ssze kell besz�ln�nk majd karakter backstoryban
az fontos XD
meg nyugotdan �rjatok dm-be
csak akkor ha szeretn�tek trackelni a sztorit
ez ugye egy oneshot lesz
nem fontos
kit�lt�m.
zes
sz�val 3-5 �ra alatt egy teljes story arcot conclusionig el kell majd vinned vhogy :D
well yes
no honestly
its just something to see if im fit to dm at all
�n szerintem egy __Sorcorer__-t kipr�b�lok
okay, Eszter van-e valami �tleted?
> focista lesz a karakterem <:diebish:694527515921743883>
xDDD
jk, csak Tacti mondta hogy szarul �rtam de... ja, marad mostm�r XD
�n hozn�k egy fighetert ha szabad?
nem, nemszabad
(ofc hozhatsz XD
akkor Clericezek probs
Alright.
Ah tel�n sokkal jobb �rni
L�nyeg�ben a kamp�ny legels� chapterj�t szeretn�m lefuttatni nektek
Hogy megn�zzem mennyire megy, mert basically az egy small dungeon crawl, prison break
nincs
xD
Mert ut�na egy teljes sandbox az eg�sz, oda menn�nek a karakterek ahova csak akarnak, annyi ideig maradnak helyeken am�g akarnak
teljesen random ker�lnek egy helyzetbe a karakterek
Yes
mindegy ki vagy, hol vagy, honnan j�tt�l, h�rtelen ott fogsz lenni ahol indul a story
IM SO DUMB TRYING TO BE VAGE: *"YOU DIES"*
oh, azt lehet j� lenne tudni XDDDD
Ohh cool
hogy �gy �rjuk a backstoryt
xD
De nem tudj�tok hogyan, mi�rt
sz�val a hal�lunkat ne �rjuk meg?
Az�rt mondom, hogy az eg�sz ilyen...mindennek a k�zep�be j�t�k, mert azt�n kamp�ny alatt der�lnek ki dolgok a m�ltatokr�l meg a j�v�r�l.
No bc its given.
Just a brief backstory and how you got to sigil and also answer and dm me the questions above.
In **bold**
Ut�na ha nagyon gyorsan v�ge lenne a chapternek, felk�sz�l�k additional dolgokkal, de t�nyleg csak azt szerettem volna, hogy dolgozzak a gmked�semen....
Bc
Well
I had bad experiences
De am
Nekem az is j� ha csak egy random oneshotot �sszedobung
Ugyan �gy Sigilben
Csak annyira hype vagyok a kamp�nyra
Hogy fixated lettem r�
My apologies :,DD
rajtad �ll mi az amit szerinted fun lenne futtatni
Meg persze hogy legyen k�vi h�tre valami session helyett
Alrighty
*casually start a whole campaign just for a onshot to be dropped off after the 1st session*
Any other questions btw?
starting equipment?
mivel 3mason kezd�nk
Don't... fuck the cat
Please
XD
<:point:951578243415302235>

H�t umh...itt azt aj�nlja, hogy starting equipment 250gp for nonmagical items and an uncommon magic item with dms approval.
alr
Beeps
Any ideas on what to make and eat ther
Also
Depends on the kitchen appliances
Do we wanna meet before we head out tomorrow?
Have no idea but I'd be happy to help out with the making of it
J�l felszerelt
I'm not against making a lasagne and shakshuka for breakfast some day
�n kor�bban bemegyek VPbe, de nem reggel-kor�n xd
Got invited to a wrap-breakfast/lunch
Oh yeah I need to make that too
Gonna run down to Spar. I need ingredients.
But Spar doesn't have the good wraps
Fuck
Ja �gy �rtem hogy kocsival egy helyr�l indulni
Onnan a parkol�b�l indulhatn�nk t�led Dani pl
Look. I'm not against traveling less <:zorablush:1021403403768844308>
De nektek nem csak egy plusz kit�r� lenne?
Ann��k �gyis menn�nek �rted nem? xD
Uuh
I don't think so
H�t ha nem nem, akkor indulhatunk innen
Nagyon apr� kit�r� max
De szerintem nem gond
Mert akkor tudj�tok k�vetni a kis suzukinkat
M�r ha utol�ritek ap�m xDD
Onnan tervezt�nk
�gy gondoltam �gyis megvan a c�m amire menni kell, azt be�tj�k Google Maps-be, azt�n megy�nk Csopakra

phat
13:30 k�rny�k�n ment�nk volna oda Mikl�ssal, de ha m�g boltba is akarunk menni akkor 13:00?
She started fucking up my umbrella while it was still left open to dry up
As an agent of chaos does
Cicimet
Boltba?
Boltba el�g ott is nem?
Lepakolunk gyorsan, megn�zz�k mi el�rhet� sz�munkra a konyh�ban azt�n ha marad az egyik kocsisunk akkor mehet�nk azonnal boltba
Ok�
Nekem m�k�dik
Alrighty
Akkor 13:30 tali a parkol�ban?
�s olyan kb 40-45kor indul�s?

Our group on a good day;
I live in a low income housing environment that goes by the government name of section 8. Me and a group of my allies control certain areas of this section to run our illegitimate business. We poses unregistered firearms, stolen vehicles, mind altering inhibitors and only use cash for financial purchases. If anyone would like to settle unfinished altercations, I will be more than happy to release my address. I would like to warn you, I am a very dangerous person and I regularly disobey the law.

Na hogy �llunk e h�tre meg k�vi h�tre emberek?
Okay I fucked up the meat and don't have it in me do it again here. I'll be bringing the rest of the ingredients and do it there.
Also. For magic items I picked Stone of Good Luck, Amulet of Devotion (+1) and Lantern of Revealing.

Kindness IS a lie
Watch the vid
It's really good
(works listen only too)
Nekem el�rel�that�lag ez az eg�sz h�t szabad, sz�val fel�lem b�rmelyik nap megfelel. A k�vetkez� h�ten vagy 11-�n vagy 14-�n bar�ti �sszej�vetel lesz (majd m�g pontos�tok, hogy melyik nap), de azon k�v�l nincs m�s elfoglalts�gom, ami �tk�zne.
I don't think that the emotional fulfillment that comes from kindness makes it a lie tbh xd
It kind of is. It's selfishness without the negative connotations.
But that's my 2 cents
Still I wouldn't call it a lie
It still happens and benefits all parties
Fair I was thinking about selfishness not it being a lie xd
Nekem a szerda kiv�tel�vel elm�letileg most j� minden m�s nap. (M�g a h�tv�ge is)
If I remember well (I listened to this vid after being awake 20 hrs, soon 24 now) he did present a pretty nice way of viewing the whole argument at the end, I definitely can't present it as well but it was about how beautiful it is that a human can find joy/happiness in helping another even without a direct reward outside of feeling good about yourself for helping someone

there are no drow or orc based npc statblocks, no more drow inquisitor and stuff like that, you are just supposed to use the standard humanoid statblock for them

I added a new module to track creatures you have met before
I ***kinda*** added retroactively the ones you already met one way or another but ofc can't remember them all

How to access it:
1. go to "compendium packs" on the right
2. find the blue box named "Bestiary Tracking Macros"
3. drag & drop "Open Bestiary" and "Open Bestiary Combat" to your numbered bar (these are the most useful ones imo)
4. use the macro

feel free to look around a bit :D

Damn, i think thats a cool *idea*

How exactly? Though?
Also I have like one really major character: Sune xd
And she didn't really get much of her arc lol
*Nika glancing at her chromatic glass dice and Ray*
*Nika glancing at the full black gothic dice set she just ordered to paint it purple and gold and glancing at Zinzana*
*Nika eyeing dice sets to paint it Scorpio themed*
*Nika glancing at her not-dice pullover she painted Scorpio themed*

I think it's a really good idea
Xd i meant molding
You need a proper, well equipped workshop for that
Okay
You need a pressure/vacuum chamber, air purifier, high grade masks, sanding equipment, and a well-ventillated area for it
Plus: You can make acrylic which when heated releases toxic fumes or resin whoch releases fumes during drying
It's a really nice idea and i'd love to pour my own dice, but we'd need really good equipment for it
<:point:951578243415302235>
And hand sanding resin, creates cancerous dust
Fun xD
If you're ordering from temu do drop in the chia metal fice please
Gotcha <:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>

I am all for supporting local businesses but god damn selling dice from Temu at 300% of the OG price is not something I'm willing to pay for.
The mold itself probably wouldn't be custom, but the colors and extras could be
Ye no xdddd
Etsy-n sokan �rulnak kocka szett mold-okat. Nika azt is meg tudja mondani melyik st�lus objectively a legjobb
That is true
I'm just saying that it's still premade
Also if you wanna use it for rolling it can't be bubbly
But can be nice
Would be off balance and "cinkelt"
*sshhhh*

The lil tiny bubbles are fiiiiiiine
I guess depends on the amount yeah
Of course when a whole ass corner is missing from a corner then ye xd

Not wanting to support Hungary. I see how it is you Chinese spy!

Imagine going swimming in it B)

That's called drowning xD
I can swim without using my legs. I was doing it in the wave pool
You'll have fins instead of legs though. Shouldn't be an issue
I didn't go to swimming classes for years to then just drown
Funny thing is, I don't think that's where I learned all these neato little things. XD I was smol and I mostly did the basic training there, so whatever I do now was just mastered through my vibes along the years
Well, sure, I can just flop with both my legs too dolphin style

Man, best part of swimming practice back then was when they let you into the warm pool with the floaties
And hungary is going to send the same exact money to china signaling to everyone that they should order more of these cuz people are buying it.
China gets less money if I send them my money directly xD

A wild halfdragon concept for Kuwe'i

||make him pregnant||
God, no, why? Xd
MAKE HIM LAY EGGS
I saw that
We're not gonna make him lay eggs
I love his legs

Ah az a farok
Looks so gooood
Gj
Thank u
Damn i gotta see more of those legs
I just love the anatomy so bad
We'll have to make him into a halfdragon first

Like these
So good
Agreed

Wtf
XD



Looks so sad xD



XD
I'm dying over this
Wow
XDDD
Nincs is sok furry karakterem
Lehet t�bb mint k�ne
I'd also would like to qualify to the "does the character look like it has seen shit no sane person can process" category
De akkor is
(it's a joke, don't overthink it)
On the other hand, I don't even know how efficiently I play in combat
Well, reaching you needs us to pass that category first, so xD
Oh ye, true. Overlooked it
Yes, it's a joke, pls guys don't get offended xD
*Ishall* XD
I don't even know what optimized means XD
Cus it's subjective
To compared to what
Or like optimised *for* what, sry just waking up
I am not optimized against dying, that's for sure, but also, only 3 of my characters **died** died
I have lot on my mind, lol
2 if we don't count Noric because of the dimensional time jump
Good morning Xd
*wondering if I could train a neural network to properly predict who's character is which*
Just a nap but ty
Pretty accurate tho
I like it
It's funny

<:highgrei:1237378027210674256> <:point:951578243415302235>
*Yes, but counterpoint to Dani not having those: Bastian* XD
Also PoB is PoB XD
I am trying to figure out tho
Pizza cutter as in?
All edge
Ah
XDD
Yes
DICEGOD XDDD
Bastian was more depressing
Than edgy
Yeah
But Grei was too chill and carefree to be edgy XD
Outside combat
which made him even more edgy
arguably
xD
He said some things that made me put down my phone and take a break from rp tho xD
XD DG getting kinky
XDDDD
*Huh?*
Ohno he took on someone's typos xdd
It was just a matter of time
Thought it'd do it sooner
XD
Did you get laid?
XDD
literally only learning stuff from this server

# GUYS
I REQUEST YOUR HELP

I NEED THIS TABLE FILLED OUT FOR EACH CHARACTER

What do we mean by basic
idk, I just copied Nika's chart
Like human basic, or is a "normal" dark elf basic?
xDDD
Cause I think for example that for a dark elf Velrus is pretty basic
Typical
Velrus for reference
<:point:951578243415302235>
probably like
"an original dnd5e phb race without a subrace that majorly changes how you'd first imagine the race's looks just by someone mentioning 'elf' or 'dwarf', etc"
is like, a close enough description
a darkelf is probs not basic in our usual teasing way where we are already being up in arms about Dani not playing a human or a dwarf
Me looking at Cake, the full on muscular tabaxi, and the question "is the character basic"?
*sweats*
okay uhm, we might need to still like, narrow it down
just a base idea
So something that deviates majorly from the usual archetype of common races, or is just niche as fuck race in general
No it's fine xD
but yea generally
*We'll figure it out*
I mean... Cake was just muscular
Otherwise, she was basic
like
standard human, dwarf, elf... orc? def basic
but yea what is basic is very subjective
tbh
80% of those questions are subjective xD
Appendix is not an �gi character btw
Tis Dani
oups, I was probs typing too fast
Nem nyitja meg
majd otthon a norm�l g�peden akkor ig
Elion k�tszer szerepel xD
lies
*sigh*
I can't do anything with it sry, it is the most accessible format: a webpage
any windows or android device can open it that I'm 100% sure about
(even if it is unwieldy on some screen sizes)
Lol
One more question
Pizza cutter as acting like it or just story?
Do half races count as basic? Half elf, half orc, etc.?
If its archetypical I think ye
I guess story mostly cause Grei XD
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
Or if the backstory isn't but the character acts like a mysterious ass that also counts
I redesigned Trygve from basically me to shaggy older woman with thigh high boots XD
(I'll be in session so can't exactly react for a bit))
R�vid�thet�nk v�laszt Y-ra �s N-re?
XD
I judges based on acts, not story
Cuz every story is edgy
Mostly
hhh, sure
I'll prbs just read the 1st letter
xD
You can have an edgy character with no edgy background, and not every character who does have an edgy backstory will act like an edgelord xD
I also judged based on looks xD
Tho that, a bit less
Yeah
But i think it's all subjective xD as Endre said
Bro is definitely not for this campaign, you're onto something dude
https://www.reddit.com/r/pathfindermemes/comments/1muniy0/gotta_take_style_points_whenever_possible
Too late xD
I don't think every story is edgy tho
Like sad maybe, unfortunate even
Yeah, fair
Good for you dicey xd

Ardenn�l mit �rjak a looks basic �s is he an animal on two legs-re? XD
Does he act how he looks? XD
All of these, yes and no
I have
no clue
xD
And also, is it early game Arden or later game Arden
Imma go with later game for simplification
My one chance to be pizza cutter, gone
*Dam*
rip
But then he doesn't look basic either. He is fucking green tinted and also plant XD
He's definitely not basic looking xD at least by the end of the campaign
That's why I'm asking which Arden should I consider for this
But the animal one is still a yes-no one
I'd go for "what first comes into mind" or like "the version most iconic" or something like that
Tho if you want, i think you could give him the edgy title, imo it'd fit
lol
https://tenor.com/view/ateez-san-ateez-no-gif-1981693534753818119

I only have the ones from <#911770517533507604> <#991473013264502825>
Heist
SFoD
I cannot for the life of me figure out which one that is xd
XD
Oh wait
It's mine xD

Yes?
Probably
<@875753704685436938>

Would you consider Csiperke hairy?
No
Fluffy tho for sure
<:point:951578243415302235>
Fluffy is not an option XD
Everything else is tho
But *no* is
xD
https://www.rxddit.com/r/Bossfight/comments/1muhzyg/mimic_couch_consumer_of_the_comfy
Szerintem arra a k�rd�sre ment a legt�bb yes-em, *mert amelyik karakterem nem big az muscular, amelyik karakterem nem muscular az hairy, amelyik karakterem nem hairy az big* XD
And any other combination inbetween
There is like 2 or 3 characters who are outside of that combo from the presented characters
I got mostly smol bitches
Weak lil hoes xD

I have some too, just not played most of them
Half my character roster is untouched
is Bastian a menace to society?
Was for certain
To other societies
Was he for Drakkenheim? I suppose
He went with the cultists
Anything not vaguely Bastian aligned is either Dead or he didn't get to it befor dying XD
*a menace to society*
<a:jesuschrist:1238062950816682136>
Technically, he's cosmic-witchy aesthetic, not cotton candy
It was on "no"
Okay
Asszem azt �rtam be xd
I like how some character's get their full names and then there's some with only their first names XD
*Consistency*
Finally a drawing since june i'm actually relatively satisfied with <:itsfine:1331345537609371659>
*For some fucking reason it's always Scorpio*
xDD
Pocketpio
prepping for the awakening?
Yeah
He's my comfort and emotional support animal
Him and Jake
Well yes
Make them kiss
@here k�vi kedd?
Thats the final step to recovery
One is straight, the other isn't xD am not gonna force it on them, ya know it's like fart
If it's forced, it's gonna be shit
seems like we need a femscorpio
Sure
We have that
Yes
Femmpio

I remember this
A changeling body oh boy would the perfect for him
But he's also like "oh i liked the male body too. I got a male body now. Nice"
At a first, quick glance, he doesn't even look that different and i love that xD
*It's not like he had that*
*If only we would've managed to kill Aren then and there* XD
*Yeah that'd have been the ideal plan* xD
Anyway xD
I do have a sketch where Scorpio and Yria kiss with his original, blond bitchboy body, in case he'd have won the fight
But he didn't
*Bisexual Yria*

Or pan
Whichever
Yea, i don't know for sure, Endre knows better xD
But honestly to me Yria feels bi
she is probably like
bi but she has no idea about it
so she thinks she is straight
xD
Aaawwww sweetheart xD
*You could've been her awakening* XD
Scorpio's like "i don't know what i'm supposed to like??? I like anything???"
*But i failed*
Dirsha
*She'll die believing she's straight*
oneshot name mentioned?
xD
XD
Ez jutott eszembe ma kor�bban is
Listen, the party is anything but straight
Not if Scorpio comes with the "would you still love me if i was a sword? Okay but did you like me when i used female forms? That was me too"
Honestly, the second question goes hard
\- Would you still love me if I was a giant ape?
\- .... I... Don't know how to react to such a question...
*Scorpio casts polymorph on himself turning into a giant ape*
\- Truthfully
Yria would be like "ofc I would", and absolutely didn't think about what that really means for her unless it is brought up
not because she is dumb about it but just, it's not smth that would be on her mind
maybe she'd have a late night thinking session a few weeks later realizing it
xD
That's sweet xD
Wow xD
-Yria please come to bed, its almost midnight....
-I...cant, I cant process.
Meanwhile Scorpio is there, smiling like a dumbass, being like "I wonder how long it'll take her to realize"
would Scorpio think about stuff like that? XD
Sometimes he would xD but he's probably on a similar kinda mindset as Yria xD
Not something on his mind 24/7
Mother. Why hast thee toucheth mine bosom?


The wha?
You once started a genshin account, and wanted to name yourself Dirsha, and you sent me a screenshot

He does look like *Dirhp*
Wtf
XDDDD
Wow
Okay
I remember when but like
Wtf
Honestly, i'd have loved to see a Dirhp
Is there a way to start as someone else other than these blonde ayaya lookin' asses?
No :(
No
Can you have a different pc character
Nooooo
I mean you can make teams
And just take out the main charactef
And even if you do have other characters in your team, these MCs will pop up in every cutscene, no matter who you have chosen in your team
*Can I have a face, please? Or better yet, a mask and fit that covers all that up?* XD
*Just tune out the ayaya. Got it*
I don't think there'll be any features that allow us to change the MC
***However***
There's a feature coming where you can make custom character cosmetics, but to the MC or other characters, i dunno :(
Main MC customization would be nice
Yeah i'd love that too
*Says like I'll play the game until my two other vibes enter the playable roster*
Yeah like xd
The game is huge tho and the story is long af, so if you wanna start, i'd recommend start asap xD
Ehe
Te nandayo
Can't I just start when they put my bois in game and try to pull them then?
Vagy ahhoz el kell jutnom valamelyik r�gi�ig, vagy szintig?
Ehe
You see
New characters are usually tied to the new regions farming-wise
So if you wanna build the character... you'll need to reach that region where you can farm for its required resources
You can definitely pull for the character, nithing's stopping you
Building it however xD
And it's aninals everywhere where we're writing about Genshin XD
I don't care about quick farming, I just want to get them. If I get them, I'll just spend the rest of my Genshin gaming focusing on them anyway XD
And it's usually hard to reach regions that are not your current plot areas xD invisible and lore and story progression walls and such
Yes
Fair enough xD
There'll be 3 characters I'll play
Father, Capitano, and Pierro
Unless they put in another one I vibe with along the way
Father, as Arlecchino Father? Or you mean the Big Fatui Father?
Arlecchino
I do have Arlecchino :3
I know
I'm currently maining her
She's super fun
Saw you wreck shit up with her
Yeeeesss
Capitano, i really hope they'll make him playable, i'd love to pull for him too
I'm stupid i'm just realizing Pierro is the big fatui father wtf
It's okay. Thought about that XD
Mixed the name up with Pulcinella xD
I mean not the name
We have Father, Captain, and *Daddy* XD
The character tied to it
*YAS*
Okay, I'd play him too. He looks classy too
J�t�k v�g�re lesz t�bb sz�z j�tszhat� karakter, �s �n ott leszek alig egy csapatnyival XD
That's okay xD at least it'll be a fun *smol* team
Yeah
But the game will make me pull ones I will never ever touch before I'll get there XD
It is how it goes xD you can't escape the fate
You. Will. Pull. Muhaha
There's also a character coming next patch, Flins, that i'm gonna pull for
The first 5star tall male model character since a year i think xD
Fit looks cool, face looks generic XD
Yeaaah, face is okay, but the rest is pretty nice
But to be fair Arlecchino's is too
But she has the fit as well
*And the cold demeanor rizz*
Arlecchino is the kind of woman with the aura that if enters the room, everyone just shuts up and steps out of the way xD
I love her
Ok�, Hall of Fame-ben sem a teljes neveiken vannak azok
It seems I didn't provide their full named

�rdekesnek tal�lom a k�t fishe-n�l, hogy Dani azt jel�lte animal on two legs, �n meg azt, hogy nem XD
I think they don't look fishy enough
Like a literal 2 legged fish
What they look like?
That's what I'm imagining by animal on two legs
I think more human would still qualify
Like fish headed scaly person

Hmm
I think this ks still more of human than animal on two legs category
Yea
Kamalanis hasonl�
Csak bitchboi k�zben
If she actually looked like fish on two legs
Put two legs on this XD
*We'te gonna be generous, it can have two arms too*
Like a pf2e athamaru would qualify as lookin like an animal on two legs

<:point:951578243415302235>
Das a fishboi and not a boifish
Like, Noric is a borzoi on two legs, ChttDrr was a crab on two legs
Csiperke was a moth
Almost
Or Zeuss, many snakes on no legs, but still xD
Yeah
What about the lokatha
Athamarus are technically locathahs
So once again, fishe with extra limbs
*ChttDrr was a power ranger*
*Wish I could've done sick kickflips and backflips as them*
*Menace the baddies with my peak physical build*

Thitch
*Dogod�k*

Do you think a Mullet would look good on me?
One way to find out
xd
Hair grows back unlike limbs! Go for whatever style you want
If its shit you cut it :p
Exactly. If the mullet doesn't work out they just do the back as well and bum, you've got a standard men's hairdo
and you've been mentioning at times, thinking about going back to short hairstyles

```This brass compass feels heavier than it should be. Half-en- cased in a leather pouch, it features an array of tools on the lid: a sundial to check the time that magically works even when the sun is obscured, and seafaring aids for measuring the distance to the horizon. Once open, its strangeness becomes even more apparent. The cardinal directions are clearly marked along the edges, but the compass arrow isn�t always visible. When the arrow is visible, it acts as a portent for the coming days, pointing to a distant or nearby location where something horrible is at risk of happening.```

Gotta find something that is a permanent withdraw after performing something like this beyond his capabilities. Eventhough the spirits helped him, this is something he shouldnt have been able to do
(most m�r tudom hogy �jf�lkor kell pr�b�lkoznom legk�zelebb xD)
Or we just say everything was rule of cool (which is just epic imo and i loved every second of it)
(yep :D)
(the spirit you saw there resting all this time was Quing, you don't know who he converses with)
(This is exactly how id love to play god damn. This was really good player dm interaction imo. I hope you didnt find it too rule breaking)

Ugye eredetileg azt akartam hogy papa lelke cser�l�dj�n ki xd
Harder control over the spirits, roll a d6, after that many spells cast (with a slot) you will get an extra little flavor or smth on your spell as you can't keep exact control over the spirits through the casting
afterwards roll a d6 again and it'll happen again after that many spells, and so on
(this is an actual mechanic written for this campaign)
(possible)
(or a saber guard)
(or idk xD)
(another possibility)
(or with Fylkir, duh)
||(jk)||
What is "that many spells"
(xD)
so you roll 4
that means the 4th spell you cast with a slot from then on will have a slip
then when it happens you roll a 3
the 3rd spell you cast has it again, etc
Ooh okay
these are just, spells getting a bit more chaotic, not always bad, just spirits do their own will for a moment, but still the spell happens
So i cast 1st lvl roll d6. Its 3 so the next time i cast a lvl 3 spell the spell is going to be weird
nonono
Does this mean Papas will got a little weakened bc of the ritual. He got so drained that his mind suffered it?
You roll now: 3
You cast spell (any, but with slot): nothing
You cast spell (any, but with slot): nothing
You cast spell (any, but with slot): slip
you roll: 2
You cast spell (any, but with slot): nothing
You cast spell (any, but with slot): slip
you roll [...]
Jaaaa

it's more like he strained this connection he has with the spirits so much that now it is harder to control sometimes

"If you want to go for a life for a life scenario, make the players go into the nearest village and kidnap an infant for the hag."
it's called "Raw Magic Table" in the campaign
If i may be bold
Id love to play more like this in the future. It was really nice
I found these for hags yes XD

Desna's Path is long gone behind, 3 *million* light-years away, once home, now not even a spec on the night sky. You and many others have fled the galaxy from a threat nobody remembers, there is a... Gap in everyone's memories and all the electronic archives. However you know your role here, you are a Starfinder, the elite spear of Project Aurora, coming to the Thyia galaxy to settle and start anew.

In this homebrew adventure you'll be playing as one of the *doers* of the colonization effort, slightly independent from the Union, here to explore the new worlds, protect the expedition, and solve any problems that might arise.

**Time:** to be agreed on, Tuesdays are most likely with a some possibility for Fridays as well, usual afternoon/evening times (weekly 3-5 hour sessions, with start times being around <t:1755871200:t> - <t:1755882000:t>
**System:** Starfinder Second Edition
**Language:** most probably English
**Adventure Type:** homebrew adventure at the minimum, very possibly growing into a full campaign as I love scifi lol
**Player Count:** I'll already start it with 3 players, but can take up to 5. I might actually prefer the 3-4 range here to make scheduling simpler.

I'll be basically branching off from the official Starfinder 2e lore, if you read after it basically imagine that this Project Aurora is a huge flagship with a few worldships accompanying it as it crosses into a new galaxy fleeing from whatever happened during the Gap.

Bocs�nat, hogy elt�ntem tegnap, de sok dologban seg�teni kellett �s f�radt voltam meg fesz�lt. Erre r� m�g keresztap�m sem volt norm�lis miut�n haza j�tt �s semmi kedvem nem volt semmihez. 
Nem szerettem volna bunk� lenni, az�rt is pr�b�ltam meg felmenni, de m�gsem tudtam norm�lisan ott lenni.
Legk�zelebb ha tudod hogy nem igaz�n tudn�l jelen lenni �s ink�bb kihagyn�d, egy "bicsi ma nem tudok lenni"-t az�rt �rhatn�l, nem fogom leharapni senki fej�t, s�t, �r�ln�k is neki ha sz�ln�l el�re
Ez �gy rosszabb hogy egy sz�t sem sz�lsz
Az, hogy k�zbej�n valami egy�ltal�n nem probl�ma. Mindannyiunkkal el�fordul. Ami frusztr�l� GM �s player oldalr�l egyar�nt az az, hogy nem sz�lsz, �s nem tudunk sz�molni a meg nem jelen�seddel.
Nincs semmi bunk�s�g abban ha sz�lsz hogy nem tudsz j�nni, magyar�zkodni sem kell, csam megmondod hogy nem tudsz j�nni
Senki nem fog haragudni
some starfinder spells are... definitely campaign meme material

While you need to use the Reposition action to move an unwilling creature around 5 ft (and it has to be grappled by you), if you have a creature Restrained, you can carry it even if it is unwilling. You just have to be able to move however many bulk they are + their equipment

*tells one person not to be too weird with new peeps*
*other person:*
*A nasty gnarl makes the drape of kelps rustle as the hag winches away at the forced politeness of the aasimar aa if it made her sick to the stomach.* -Oh...how respectful...how..handsome... *Her ugly and sickly voice rumbles low, more monstrous, dripping with sarcasam and hate as he listens to Enwir's weak rejections. All of a sudden, she chackles sharp and  mockingly scornful at the gumptious bravery of the young man, truly not in his best shape to shine his charisma.
After a long hurl, taking a bubbly breath, soak in phlem, she says.*
-Ample? *She exhales a surpisingly soft giggle, showing his amusement.* - If this is the most they can offer then it is certainly not going to get you faaaarhh... Oh, no-no, not here....not noooow. A clowfish lies better than you, lost little pupp.
*Despite how vicious, her words are honied, candied like turkish delight.*
-And I'd rather not ask anything from you, but to leave this beach and not taint it with your angelic beauty...
*She spits those words of compliment like venom from her tea and she takes a second to smell the air.* 
-Even if you are as dirty as the sand here, rotting within, I wish not to maddle with you for all its worth.... A simple favour to rid of you and to wish you luck on your journey ahead... *The Granma's voice, charming and ill.* -I know you are looking for someone...I can help you find them. I'm the only one who can help...you are aloooone.
*Enwir can feel the air sticking to his chest like a slimy membrane as the crushing realization hits him on how alone he is right now. The sky is grey, the sand is soaked with blood, nothing but chaos and disaster surrounds them...Alone...never a chance.*
-I help you...you leave...*that* is my offer... *She holds her grey arm out once again, reaching for Enwir but not daring to touch him at all.*

(I think its pretty simple xd)
( *wriggle eyebrow* l
(*The landlady kicks you out*)
(Well she only like ugly)
They are together for a reason...
*Not a twitch of the eye, a frown, or any other visible sign betrays of how much these blatant insults and jabs at his suffering body have bitten into his ego, his dignity, his self-image. Hearing these come from such a haggard, nasty old thing is embarrassment of the highest level, one he would not tolerate if he would have the upper hand, but as of now he has to swallow his pride to gain the best outcome. This is the most straightforward deal he has ever heard from such vile creatures, and he is willing to take it to lift this echoing feeling of loneliness from his chest, leave this forsaken beach. He opens his mouth to speak, his voice much more nonchalant now.*
- And I will be glad to take it. Bring me to him and we will be off your land soon enough.

# Starfinder Terminology & Names

Infosphere: The local planetary (or shipwide while in space travel) information network.

Desna's Path: the original SF2e galaxy

Drift: a mysterious plane allowing for FTL travel through some magical means

Magitech: magic combined with technology, some powerful stuff, although mostly carrying the weaknesses of technology, not magic (they usually count as magical, but cannot be dispelled or countered; you can't dispell the magic from a spaceship's Drift engine)
# Campaign Specific Terminology & Names
-# and some loredrops...

Project Aurora: A megaproject to build a basically smaller planet sized worldship that is capable of crossing between galaxies. While the Drift makes it way faster than millions of years, a journey such as this still needed groundbreaking innovations both in the fields of technology and magic.
Aurora: the flagship of the project, set up with a special magitech drive, allowing it to cross from Desna's Path to Thyia in "just" a few hundred thousand years. This drive also allowed it to create a ripple through which 5 worldships could follow only a few years behind, even though these are only equiped with conventional Drift engines. Aurora's captain has ultimate authority over the flagship until it has been successfuly rebuilt into the Aurora Station, at which point the Union takes over as a govermental body.

The Union: is the govermental body of the new colony system. They operate through a council with a singular council leader who's purpose is to speed up politics in the early stages of the colonisation effort.

The Starfinders: are the elite explorers of the expedition, responsible for finding and securing resources, safeguarding new colonies, and smoothing out any hitch Project Aurora might run into after their arrival. They are independent from the Union, to make sure they can focus on their task unhindered by bureaucracy or politics.

Worldships: 5 worldships followed Aurora's ripples in the Drift: Aether, Arcadia, Eidos, Exodus, and the Prometheus. Each bringing a smaller civilisation worth of people in cryostasis, and each jumping to a different nearby star system to set up their own starting colonies before rejoining the Aurora.
- Aether is the technological center of the expedition.
- Arcadia is responsible for agriculture and the expedition's food production.
- Eidos is bringing the cultural heritage of the people along with diplomats, merchants, and alike.
- Prometheus is set to build out the main industrial hub of the new colony system.
- Exodus is not fully part of Project Aurora, but instead an independent worldship acting in alliance with the expedition and later with the Union.
Dunno xD

I don't think her weapon has a silencer sooo xD
Important that this is star finder, and tech augments technically only go on tech weapons if I remember right
And it says muzzle or hilt.
We will give her a high tech axe
I found the loudener because the silencer said a weapon without a loudener xddd
\- Stealth is just an option during this mission.
*Starts screwing a loudener on the muzzle*

<@&1408766988548837469> just noting, we are aiming for next week Tuesday for session 0
(unless yall want to do it earlier sometime but I'm pretty sure someone is always busy before that xD)
Tbh if later today works for everyone I would be down for that too, even if just for like 1hrs
So we have some thinking time for next week for characters
I'll be home in 3 and a half hours ish if that works
I am free all day today.
Eszter forgot how to read calendars and had smth today, thus why we need to cancel
xD
idk what it is or how long it lasts, but if <@332925665424834560> gets home and wants to chat a bit I'm down
If she is busy today she might be too tired for it I guess
Yeah let's leave it up to her then. If she feels up for it, I'd be down tho!

# PENGEDALNOK
Hagyj�l b�k�n
lil' teaser, just finished with the most basic Union Trooper statblock (these will be the most standard allies that might be around in some places)

# PENGEDALNOK <:dracthyr_no2:1004775944000647268>
They shall have a Weakness to coerce, due to police\military corruption >:)
Nice statblock, didn't think you'd be homebrewing those too :o
I guess with this campaing you did make yourself a lot of work, huh? :D
they have a fairly low will saves so ig ye XDD
True true xD
well, since the GM Core and Monster Core are not out yet, yea I'll be making 90% of the stablocks by hand
oooooooooooo
I didn't know that
the rules how to *run* the game is not out yet yea XD
just how to make characters and the pc options xD
xD
(GM Core is out in a month or so I think?)
I am curious about this. Does this mean they are similar leve to our PCs?
Welcome home
Also don't feel like you must say yes, I am just hype to be in a non fantasy setting as a player :p
yes it'll always be based to your level
I think similar is like +-1
(these guys are lvl1)
OKi
oh and their art :D
Nice! :D
i mean if I drink a coffee i can be there... Not for long tho
Ben is still 3 hours ish away
so feel free to just sleep for the day :P
Well leaving it up to you but you know
Don't overwork yourself
oh yea he is 3 hours I forgor, no
if Eszter is up 3 hrs from now I'm poking her in the head with a Baton
xD
They are called Stunbatons for a reason
as you can see on the statblock they are nonlethal
Yeah that's what I mean
it's not a question of want, it's a question of "when you'll run into slave traders"
<@332925665424834560>, are you a slave trader by any chance? He does want to bonk you. :o
like she'd ever confess to that
xD
true
Nope why would I?
Eszter needs to sleep cus of work so sadly not :s

is "drug use" adult content?

honestly mostly just trying to keep sexual topics away from other more public places as those are more strictly controlled (not like we'd ever be audited but u know, just in case xD)
yep
Wow we aren't actually doing that bad? That... That is surprising wow
Well france probably has such a high one, since you get lie 2k� after every kid you have as am asylum seeker
So most of the Muslims coming from Africa dont actually have to work
They are about to change the laws around that, they realised they can't keep up with it anymore
I think a lot of other western and Nordic countries have something similar
Yeah that is... Ah that's a hard topic with so many pitfalls
Yeah i dont mind helping asylum seekers, but not to the point where they live like kings without having to do anything
Cuz on one hand yes they need the support, that's why they are there, on the other, that money is coming out of the every day people's taxes, which regular folk usually don't really appreciate.
ooh a immigrent problem is an issue everywhere now
i was in the netherlands and there are also a lot of them
sooo many immigrants
I dont know their laws, but maybe something similar?
also most of them dont really do anything with that support
I just met my French relatives, and most Muslims dont cause issues and even intermarry woth Christians, but there is always that super orthodox layer of them, that would murder the ones marrying christians if they can.
�n ink�bb a tanulatlanabb r�tegre gondoltam
ez olyan hogy itthon sem csin�lnak sok mindent a kisebbs�g azzal amit adnak nekik xd
I wouldnt say that. They can be very well versed in text and still think thay way
my point still stands regardless
Even we as christians have that
im not saying we dont
I know
oh ye
so yeah
its an issue
they just cant put that many people to work
�s erre j�n r� m�g pluszban az, hogy van aki nem is akar csin�lni semmit cs
There is a reason Populist (right wing) parties are getting so strong in all of the EU
XD
We should make sure to ask the DM before deleting a room. Just in case xD
Yeah
look it was in the archives area for months xD
In austria they got into office. In germany it wasn't far cuz their extreme socialist party is swinging between first and second most preferred party
They got second but are pushed out by an alliance of 3 other parties
yea, not having proper laws to support immigrant integration causes a lot of issues >.<
well i dont think many of the first world countries really prepped for that xd
as far as im concerned many of them just took them in without a question
thats why poland and hungary really started to close off borders
that much i could gather
which was as a gesture nice
but as humans shown it many times, not planned long term xD
ye
Honestly none of them would have came here or there in the first place haha. We didn't have any programs for them.
Hungary closed borders to get political tracion xD
Yeah pretty much.
we actually had positive infrastructure growth from them
cus they paid for trains and such
yeah bc we dissed them from the getgo xd
to just pass the country
to pass through the countrey, yes xd
(and cus we are relatively the same or doing worse than the place they flee from xD)
sorta kinda
it's like
you weren't flee from Hungary to like, mexico or chille
oh yeah
if you are fleeing you gonna go to somewhere clearly better
i mean still would be better than stay in a war-scarred country
Deleting a room wha
I mean we ARE better in every way shape and form for them. But at the same time, if they only travel for an extra day, get to france per se,they can live like kings for free
Why stay here and work your ass off for half the pay, if even that
Ideally
and you dont get bommbed in the middle of the night
Agreed. Hungary might be in a bad spot in relation to other european stage, but on the world wide level we're still well above avarage in comfort.
yup
specially now before the elections xdddd
But of course when you can pick between a comfy motel or a 4star resort you'll pick the resort.

```You can also attempt to throw an item to someone. You typically need to succeed at a DC 15 ranged attack with a 10-foot range increment to do so.```

Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature's location if that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.The spell can locate a specific creature known to you or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) if you have seen such a creature up close�within 30 feet�at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as under the effects of a Flesh to Stone or Polymorph spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.This spell can't locate a creature if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path between you and the creature.
ahogy a hold elkezd felkelni Kuwe'i l�tja nagyon nagyon faintly Qing-et ahogy elkezd megjelenni, de once again, ez nagy es�llyel k�s� �jjelre lesz teljes

*You hear a voice in your head.*
- So you have come to fulfill your destiny, child?
- I have. Although, do you still... like, you know, your blessing... It's no longer pure.
- Yes, I can feel Skati's corruption seeping in, we'll remedy it later. For now the question is do you think you are ready to break chains even I cannot touch?
- I am ready. I died to be here in this moment.
"When gold dims and sorrow binds,
seek the ember where twilight winds.
A heart once shattered, a future untold,
rise anew from ashes cold.

The guardian�s whispers fade to night,
lest the lost one claim her right.
Break the chains, unveil the way�
lest darkness reign where dawn should stay."
- I have called you here because serius issues child. It is an issue of my daughter, Quarala, you see she is in great sorrow ever since my death, yet I cannot fathom why. She's meant to be a great protector, a shield of the Isles like I once was yet she refuses to leave my tomb, blaming herself of all the death that happened on that cursed night.
- I would love to talk with her, but I'm afraid she'd refuse me, even try to kill me on sight as soon as she senses the black dragon's "blood" in me.
- I can see that being the case, very well. Talk with the Watching Woman, and tell her that Qing sent you to call in my favor. She can cleanse you of the wretched black blood and make you pure again. Once you are done, return and face the trials of the steps again, and fulfill the destiny I have given you, free my daugther of her sorrow.
- After I free your daughter and her another chance to fulfil her potential, what will happen to you? Are you going to fully disappear?

- I'll continue to serve the endless cycle of life and death, the endless decay up until my daugther's time comes and she can ascend to lay me to rest one last time.
- Is there a way for me to become more like you? Much more... draconic? That way I could also fulfil my own wishes after helping Quarala, to become the protector of my own people.
- There is only one ritual I know of that could adress you with such powers, but it is more wretched than Skati's own magic.
- So there's really no way for me to ascend? To become greater? I mean I love to help others, help you, yet... This doesn't feel a single bit fulfilling on my side. I might even lose my life for good if your daughter just decides she doesn't like me!
- She has not harmed any who ascended through the trials, to be completely honest, I believe she wouldn't even defend herself if someone would dare to raise arms upon her. This task is not to fulfill you but to make sure the isles survives, it is for your people and those who'll come after you, don't you see the importance of your destiny?
- Okay. Then I have one last thing to ask. If she refuses to fulfil her destiny, even after us trying to help her. Can I take her role?
- I have faith in your success Kuwe'i Malakai.
- There are things that are not only dependent on a single mortal's decision. Your daughter has her own free will.

*In the night Papa feels that two of the souls he's been catering for try to reach out to him, two powerful warriors, one Ikolf, one Manaki, seemingly good old friends.*

*Papa feels the power of the spirits well up in his chest and he takes a deep breath and clutches his amulet. His aura takes up the usual dark-green and black shade, the spirit particles cavalcading around his closed fist and puffed up chest. He tries to focus on the two spirits to see their visage.*

- Qing said your
I'll just write out a few facts the party knows:
- Qing says that he doesn't fully know why Quarala acts like this.
- Quarala and the ancient black definitely had something between them, but this is deemed to be something that cannot be spoken of, it has been ordered to be a secret by *one of the* gold dragons.
- Qing has a clear hatred of black dragons.
hm? :D
there was no signs that the egg was tampered wit
*As Papa meditates he sees the duo appear in their spectral forms. The Manaki keeping a hand on the Ikolf's shoulder as he speaks with a bow.*
- Father Kaitiaki, we are grateful you've heard our prayer. We have felt that you are heading towards our final resting place, may we have a wish?
(yes)
(so its gay pocahontas and dwarf john smith?)
*Papa is shocked for a second but feels grateful at the appearance of the two spirits manifesting before him.* -Why, of course. I am glad to help the great defenders of the Isles if it means to guard their eternal dreaming. That is the work I heartfully do.

*The dwarf takes over the word stepping a bit forward with a bittersweet smile.*
- You see we have fallen to our own hubris and greed, trying to show our greatness to the spirits of the isles. We have captured a great beast and brought it to the old ruins to fight it in front of the mountain's watching eyes. However... it has bested us, refusing to die as we have fought for long hours while even the skies themselves turned against us.
*You can see that speaking of this failure is not one he does lightly.*
- We ask of you to finish what we have started, deal with the beast so our failure's black spot is erased from this world and we may be forgotten in peace.

- The people have named it Rok'Hal the Devouver, as it not only taken our lives but so did many good hunters afterwards. The only thing that has been able to hold it captive is the shrine Kada has raised around it.

sooo... anybody who can crochet, can you stop the reason of my frustrations with this pattern?

<@875753704685436938> you have been called for
I'm questioning many things; the pattern shows a 6 point "star", but the picture shows a top made of 5 point "stars", and also, it's just the patter of a single star, not the entire top xD
the top is made of 5 stars. but the issue is... yes, it's a 5 pointed star, not a hexagon
Yeah
I suggest looking for a... *new* pattern xDD

I have not found any equivalent to this, in my opinion, crucial action for a ranged firefight oriented game. So I made this basic action anyone can take, what do you guys think?


oh yea I'll ping in case someone would need it <@&1408766988548837469>

That would be helpful even in Pathfinder tbh. There were situations where I needed to use 2 actions moving out of cover, and then back in after attacking.
one negative effect this might have is that people will be more "dug into cover" which can make fights feel stale
Hmm I guess we will have to see

Wtf
the more I'm looking at this
the worse I think it'll do to the pace of the game xD
I have been told that I'm stupid
This is under ``cover`` -> ``special circumstances``
```Your GM might allow you to overcome your target�s cover in some situations. If you�re right next to an arrow slit, you can shoot without penalty, but you have greater cover against someone shooting back at you from far away. Your GM might let you reduce or negate cover by leaning around a corner to shoot or the like. This usually takes an action to set up, and the GM might measure cover from an edge or corner of your space instead of your center.```

I am reading about scientific racism, and this is some other level shit
We must cure the black skin disease
At least he thought blacks were equal I guess. But only because they are all secretly white.
Xddd
Scientific racism is something that is important to accept that it existed and in some way still exists, and that we should do better than that
I am reading the whole wiki article about it and a lot of them believed in it, but didnt think whites were superior. Which is a lot more than what you can say about a lot of people nowadays lol.
There are a bunch of emotional abuse signs that people tend to miss in their lives. These are *clear signs of emotional abuse* **IF** they are repeated/commonplace. Everyone slips up from time to time. These are abuse *patterns* that hold through time.

Original post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/s/qxbMfB3mhd>

OP: "It took me 10 years to see these patterns for what they are: abuse, not love."

- They give you the silent treatment, freezing you out for hours, days, or longer until you�re the one apologising just to make it stop.

- They �joke� about your family or friends in a dismissive way, making you feel silly for caring about them.

- They habitually lie about small, everyday things; where they are, who they�re with, until you start doubting your own instincts instead of their honesty.

- They nitpick how you do small daily tasks (cooking, tidying, shutting a door) as if you can�t get the simplest things right.

- They constantly chase validation through friends of the opposite sex, coworkers, or anyone who feeds their ego � brushing it off as �just friends.�

- They use exhaustion, work, or stress as permanent excuses to avoid pulling their weight at home.

- They hide behind an addictive personality, leaning on drugs, alcohol, or porn instead of facing problems, leaving you to carry the emotional weight.

- They treat you like their personal servant expecting water, food, or a spotless house on demand, while doing little for you in return.

- They expect sex on demand and guilt-trip you if you�re not in the mood, turning intimacy into an obligation instead of a choice.

- They downplay your excitement over things (�they�re just strangers,� �why does that matter?�) until you stop sharing.

- They use being tired, stressed, or hungry as an excuse for name-calling or cruel words.

- They insist anger �justifies� disrespect � as if the words don�t count because they were mad.
|| ||
- They withhold compliments unless they�re paired with criticism (e.g., �that�s nice but you should�ve��).

- They mock your hobbies, dreams, or small wins in subtle ways that make you doubt if they�re worthwhile.

- They claim they �don�t remember� saying something hurtful, making you question your own memory.

- They demand your full attention in moments that shouldn�t require it, punishing you if your mind is elsewhere.

- They mirror your vulnerabilities back at you (e.g., using your insecurities in arguments).

- They suddenly flip into kindness after cruelty, leaving you feeling guilty for still being upset.

- They make �jokes� that only cut one way � you feel uncomfortable, but they say you�re too sensitive.

- They point out the money they�ve spent on you as evidence of love, while avoiding emotional effort.

- You feel like you�re on eggshells around them, constantly scanning their mood. When they walk into the room, you jump up or tense instead of being able to relax.

- They accuse you of being ungrateful when you express needs or ask for help.

- They minimise verbal abuse with phrases like �I didn�t mean it� or �I was just angry.�

- They treat your pain like a distraction from their own stress, as if your feelings are inconvenient.

- They share personal details or jokes about you with others that make you uncomfortable, then brush it off as �banter� or a �joke� while you�re left embarrassed.

- They interrupt your rest or downtime with demands, but become annoyed if you disturb theirs.

- They claim your boundaries are �unfair� or �too much� whenever those boundaries inconvenience them.

- They suddenly become affectionate after sensing you�re pulling away, just enough to keep you hooked.

- They imply you�d struggle without them (financially, emotionally, socially) so you start doubting your independence.

- They tell you you�re �lucky� to have them, but rarely make you feel cherished in practice.

- Even in our time this beast was a legend, the Devouver appeared on any of the Isles where life started to stall, it demolished ancient ruins that have been untouched by time, uprooted families who acted like they own the lands itself. If one wasn't wiser they'd think it is an 8th half-immortal in disguise.

Good idea
I shall title it, psychoanalysis of Barbara's "szia te geci"



Will we finish the first layer at last?
Not this time. But we'll hopefully reach the start of the end. 2-3 sessions are left. Depends on if we can play a longer irl session for the finale
Hossz�h�tv�g�n lehetne egy nagysession majd okt�berben.
N�lunk lesz hely
�s onnan meg mehetnek az emberek mobdokonra
Nem tudom a macsk�kat kire b�zni/hova rakni, meg nincs is sz�vem �ket hurcol�szni (eln�zve hogy a Gandalf milyen rosszul viselte a k�lt�z�s/nyaral�s id�szakot)
We could meet at your place someday tho
for finale session
Reg�'s or mine?
Your's
Nem musz�ly ott aludni
That way you don't have to worry about the cats
Heh
or at Reg�'s with you going home with the last bus
Oh to have free will

De am egy est�t csak kib�rnak, hogy ne kelljen ANNYIT buszozni
�s akkor XD

<@&1408766988548837469>s

Character Finalization:
Make sure you have the right Equipment (150 credit of items + 35 credit of free stuff that I already added for total of 185 credit networth)
- have at least some rations
- have a comms unit cus your caster needs it to inspire you
- have some armor without the exposed trait
- whatever else you need
- don't forget ammo :)

Send me the backstory preferably like a day before session at least

Send me character art if you have not done so before (I can turn it into a token dw)
oh AND
in your backstory
give me 3 people you know that are in cryo aboard the Aurora or one of the worldships
In the <#1408767052742791279> I added:
- The new galaxy's name (Thyia)
- Which ship you all be starting on (Arcadia, the agricultural worldship, most important of them all :D)
- The Variant and Homerules we'll be using (I'll mention them when they come up)
Session 1 <t:1757599200:R>
<t:1757599200:f>
Oh if you need it for the backstory: the Arcadia ship's primary Starfinder is Nenvi (he/him, Ikeshti), he is your direct boss
https://youtu.be/UkgoSOSGrx4?si=DjoSGfwe71Lz1Mu7
Yeah �ron is pretty close too
we should go there sometime if you'd want, it is a pretty cool place :D
since someone asked for backstory purposes:
__Question__
About how many people are on the ships altogether?

__Answer__
Aurora is carrying about 50 million people
each worldship carries around 10 million people

all in cryo, most are some kind of professionals/skilled individuals, only the best for such a colossal colonization effort, except maybe on Exodus where seats could actually be bought with credits, although they have a pretty good lineup of people still

I GOT OURSELVES SOME CHARACTER SHEET SKINS
(alt light theme)
Just a mention, you guys don't have to add it but just so you don't forget, the main point of Project Aurora was to flee from Desna's Path. However *why* they were fleeing the whole previous galaxy is covered in collective amnesia (and all records of it seem to have vanished like even amongst your own electronics or written papers if you had like notes or recent documents any, mention of what the threat was is instead just... empty)
**Original Recruitment Post**
Desna's Path is long gone behind, 3 *million* light-years away, once home, now not even a spec on the night sky. You and many others have fled the galaxy from a threat nobody remembers, there is a... Gap in everyone's memories and all the electronic archives. However what you know is your role here, you are a Starfinder, the elite spear of Project Aurora, coming to the Thyia galaxy to settle and start anew.
(as in? xd)
(as in staying in one place for too long. arent they all nomadic?)
(so they dont use the land for too long?)
(yes but some tried to move from these traditions, this is when Rok'Hal usually appeared)
Anyone minds if I'll practice speaking out Finnish when speak as aliens u guys don't understand? XD
(huh this is a hard question tho)
(mi lenne az ami fel� papa hajlana ink�bb. mert el�g �szrevehet� szerintem, hogy � mennyire tradicion�lis.)
(and now its like...hmmm...if this is a force of nature that keeps others in check...mmmmh maybe there is a reason why the spirits want this)
(just saying that currently a huge majority of the Manaki people are forced to cover in Makolf or Keyport)
(ahh so this is the time of change)
(hmmmm)
(or like time for exceptions)
(but nontheless...this might mean that papa has to go against the spirits will?)
(Well, make sure to look through the evidence of what this thing done before, why it got locked away by the half-immortals and what Papa would make of the whole story, and decide for yourself. You can also seek the wisdom of the many, asking your party to see what each of their looks are on the topic before you decide)
(yeah defo)
(but this is an exciting question)
(but anyways, my opinion is that as civilization thrives so does the need for space grows. So as the population grows it is inevitable to not settle down)
(hmmmm civilization? ayo?)
(CIV6 gameplay?)
(XD)
(I'd love to, but uni just started again, and I have 5 sessions a week xD)
(but yes this is correct... ***if*** population grows xD

# Story Baseline
```In the bustling underbelly of Asken City, a thriving metropolis, Krav Chomok was born to an enthusiastic family of Ysoki known for their skills in negotiation and diplomacy. The youngest son of renowned ambassadors, he grew up amidst scrolls and data slates filled with treaties and vivid tales about forming alliances with diverse races across realms near and far. His mother often insisted that words could be more powerful than weapons, while his father taught him the importance of understanding one's cultural nuances. These lessons coalesced into a burning desire within young Krav to venture beyond his home-world, hoping to etch out peaceful beginnings in uncharted territories.

Whispers floated through Ysoki Society that a habitable galaxy had been discovered. With bated breath yet insatiable ambition coursing through him like electric currents, Krav volunteered for this monumental task. Adorned with trinkets from various cultures he'd studied over years, and sporting prominent teeth forever bearing markings dubbed "BoggleMaw" by his peers, he boarded an experimental ship called Arcadia. His mission: not just colonization but crafting bonds between possible races whose histories were as uncertain as their futures together.```
# Allies\Friends
- Clan Chomok members that joined him on the journey, (a few on every vessel) including his younger sister, a highly skilled mechanic named **Koggis Chomok** aboard Prometheus. (He will try to keep in touch with her as much as possible.)
- A leading Human diplomat whom he knew since childhood and is a mentor\father figure to him named **Warren Anderson**. (He is the one who got a place for Krav on the ship.) 
- A Vlaka enforcer \ solider named **Ysadys Clemol**, who is in the expedition in case it would meet resistance in the form of alien creatures. She is quiet and reserved when not around her friends, but chatty when she is. They have been close friends for years and she applied to the expedition after Krav told her he was accepted. Acting as something like a bodyguard for him, whenever Krav�s diplomacy failed.

> An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. When you create the aura and at the start of each of your turns while it persists, you can restore 2d6 Hit Points to one creature in it.
A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.__Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn't make a save; it simply withers and dies.__

> A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a Cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius.When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one.If you're outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.

I have been reading on how your multi arms work
you have 2 arms that are "active"
and the other 4 are not
you can only wield *weapons and shields* in active hands EVERYTHING ELSE you can do with the other 4 too
- healers toolkit stuff
- grapple/trip/etc maneuvers 
- spell gems/medpatches/hypopens/etc any kind of activation items (that is not weapon or shield)
- anything needing a free hand if any 1 of your 6 hands is free

# Marrow
Marrow was one of the Star Breather�s rib bones, and is the strongest symbol of both power and authority in the Isles. It was used to seed Kadaur, the first island, which later fostered all others. When Kada chose to manifest, he ventured into the heart of Kadaur and took the bone, which he would then use to further protect the new nature of the Isles.

You have a **+2** bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit a creature that has less than half its maximum hit points with Marrow, you can force the target to make a **DC 22** Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes paralyzed, immovable, and invulnerable for **14 days**. If the spear is removed from the affected creature, the effect ends early. Once this property has been used, it can�t be used again until the next dawn.

*Papa when he prances around on the beach in the distance*
*To be alone for so long and learn to cherish the small things in life...The simple and obvious. To move with the pace of nature, when the spirits dictate your step, you truly know you have a sacred life. It is just an obvious priviliage not everyone gets to have. For what other reason the Starbreather created life, if not for to share it with his children and those who are willing to fall into the rythm of creation. We should be thanking him for letting us live here and rejoice in the colours of the Isles.... "sigh"..... But what other secrets may lie out there? Unfathomable and dangerous things that we still don't know about. Should we live in blissful ignorance for the rest of our days and let things rest in the graces of our mythical half-immortals hands? What are we if not sentient beings who live to learn and thrive in evolution? This is absolutely contradictory....How does a mountain, even when standing so tall, withstands the molding hands of men that comes to shape it into their image?
Is it the change that is our god-given duty from the Starbreather, or something that grows from within, driving us to act to our own selfish accords?  
"Sigh" I am clueless...How shall I decide, wether I am worthy of aiding those who cannot see or to go with flow of the water? Is it the spirits, or is it just me, also an outsider, who cant see beyond his pitiful needs after all?
Oh, how much I've given up to lead this life and change for the better, only to be pushed away because of who I am. Who is it I am to follow? What is my worth....to you? 
"He looks up at the sky above." 
Well, thus this is my trial for life...
"He shoots an ironic smile and touches his stone."
Spirits of old, help me see...*

Mikor j�n a gyerek?
Max p�r h�nap ha m�r pelussal terveznek.

Okay, so, backstory:
Name: Agnes �Nessa� Harlan [she/her] 
Age: 36
Originally from Desna�s Path�s equivalent of the Edwardian period (1903, to be specific), Nessa was a victim of a mysterious temporal catastrophe at the age of seventeen, which saw a whole town displaced in time (about 200-250 people all together). Although she managed to adapt to the new environment better than most � even becoming proficient in handling the weapons and tech while trying to make ends meet as a gun for hire � Nessa still struggles with feeling out of place and isolated, as well as a constant pining after a home she�ll likely never be able to return to. She also has a deeply ingrained � and somewhat hypocritical � mistrust of technology, especially augmentations. Not to the extent that she would judge other people for getting any but she would prefer to avoid them unless absolutely necessary [Nessa is basically that �The only piece of technology in my house is a printer� meme]. She also has a preference for analog/archaic over tech weapons and items � overall, Nessa tries (and at times fails) to balance practicality with her own reservations about technology.
Not many of Wyndham�s (the displaced town) residents managed to adapt and survive, and even fewer made it aboard one of Project Aurora�s ships. One of them is Nessa�s older brother, Edgar [human, he/him], who ended up becoming a weaponsmith and was given a berth aboard Aether for his skill. Another, Laurelin Myr [elf, she/her], originally a naturalist visiting Wyndham to study the local fauna, was placed on Eidos to preserve her unique perspective and knowledge. There is also a gun for hire, T�aru [shobhad, he/him], who Nessa is acquainted with (they were part of the same mercenary guild and occasionally partnered up for jobs) aboard the Arcadia.
Miscellaneous stuff:
� She keeps an old penny dreadful (The Curious Case of the Ghostly Gentlewoman) with her at all times, as it�s one of the few things she still has from her old timeline. Another is a silver hatpin her mother had gifted her.
� Nessa and her brother had just settled in the town, and so none of their other family were present to be caught up in the temporal anomaly.
� She does tend to have a bit of a �bAck iN My dAy� syndrome, and views her original time through rose-tinted glasses.
� She doesn�t like to curse because she thinks it�s improper (but will definitely do so if she gets worked up enough).
� She hates fish.
Also, art:

Thx bot
Anyway, let me know if I should change or add anything, to better fit with the LOREtm
I also picked out art for the mentioned characters (mostly to help myself visualize them), so I can send those over as well, if you'd like

Game Mastery Guide rules and notes
I'll be spamming them here so it can be found localised later.
# Space / Vacuum / 0g combat stuff
Asian English be like
I shall marry this Christmas
## Area Damage
**Most** area damage to __untethered__ creatures also pushes them outwards at enough speed to clear the area of effect (after it's damage and such has been applied). So if you were just barely 5 feet into the AoE you get pushed 5 feet out, if you were at the center of the 30 feet burst you get pushed 30 feet, etc.
As per normal this means you have a new speed and direction you are floating in.
## Ranged Attacks
Ranged attacks in vacuum **or** zero gravity have double the range/range increment and only take a -1 for each new range increment instead of -2.
Ranged attacks in **both** vacuum **and** zero gravity have four times the range/range increment and ignores all penalty for going over the first range increment (effectively allowing you to shoot a 100 feet range increment weapon to 2400 feet without any drawbacks (the fact you can only shoot your weapon to up to the 6th range increment stays))
## Energy Damage
**Non-magical** effects with the ``Fire``, ``Cold``, or ``Electricity`` trait only work if there is physical contact.
There are some exceptions to this for example laser weaponry is fully effective.
## Persistent Damage
Persistent bleed is much more dangerous in vacuum as it usually includes ruptures. The DC to recover from bleeding increases from DC15 to 17.
<@&1408766988548837469>
There is a special rule on vacuum combat that creatures in vacuum are immune to persistent cold and fire damage. I'd say the exact opposite as there is a lack of medium that would help disperse the heat/lack of heat.
Do we go with immunity or do we go with it instead being actually harder to recover from? (upping the DC from flat 15 to flat 17 which mirrors the bleeding changes)
-# small reminder to new peeps: persistent damage ticks at the end of your turn then you roll a clean d20 and on a success against the DC the persistent damage ends
## Movement and Momentum
Unless something stops you fully most momentums are additive (basically vector math addition, I'm probably gonna code up a little tool to help me track this)
## Kickback
While untethered shots that use projectiles or petrol as ammunition pushes you and the target (on a successful hit in the opposite direction by 5 feet **per weapon damage die**.
Spells that fire a projectile dealing piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage act the same way.
I mean depends on the heat tbh. If you actually burn, it shouldn't work in vacuum.
I do want to mention that there is already a rule that **Non-magical** effects that have the fire, cold, or electricity trait does not work in a vacuum *unless* there is physical contact (like a cryoblade)
So this will *almost* exclusively be magical persistent damage
*there is a subsystem for a complex hacking encounter, huh?*
XD

some of these are a bit funny / not the style I'll be running stuff in (like the last one XDD)

Didn't even think

*Papa sees something gargantuan move under the water, pushing the waves out further on the shore as it passes by, but the water simply swirl around the ritual, leaving a dry circle around him. After another moment the water rises up and forms a complete bubble around Papa. The gargantuan being swims around him, bit too far to take out exactly in the blue murky depths of the water, but it is truly gargantuan, has some kind of pointed nose, and almost as if huge strands of branching seaweed has been stuck to many places of it's body. If Papa really concentrates he can even see the shining of scales... although they seem to be backwards on the creature, pointed right against the currents making it's movements much less than agile.*
*A voice echos trough the waves, it is not real, just telepathy but still as if all things, mortal or immortal resonate with it.*
- Potential. You come for it. It opens, it runs wild, it burns the old faith. From fire, new is made. It is yours. Shape it. Make it bend to your hand.
*Papa understands that while this creature is not responding to the ritual's question, it is the divine magic that allows it to manifest so prominently. After which it swims further away and some of the water clears around him, he is suddenly back at the shipwreck of the Bloody Twins. A galleon is floating above, it's anchor smashed into the coral growing nearby. The Bloody Twins is getting unburried from it's grave, close to a hundred sunken sailors relentlessly working to move it. Keelhaul is angrily looking around the ship, walking up to the front of the ship and boxing into the wood where the two wooden mermaids once were. Takes out a small compass-looking item, sadly at an angle unreadable from the air bubble. Keelhaul's thoughts echo in Papa's mind.*
- I'll have my ship, *then I'll have my prize*.
*The water become murky again, then completely clear, it is not even underwater anymore, just a watery bubble above Skati's Temple, who immadiatelly locks eyes with Papa and shouts in anger.*
- **KEAHI!!!**
*As a red lightningbolt flies from Skati's fingertip the spell suddenly ends, Papa is back on the beach the waves barely just washed away the remains of the burnt incense.*
---
- I fear that I've given you the wrong impressions young Kuwe'i, and I look to make amends. My powers are not to be given, not even by me, but grown into. My final time is of yet far, but so is anyone from being able to overtake it once it comes. I see my daughter as the pride of my clan, and it hurts to see her like this even if the need for the grand powers of an ancient like her are much needed on the isles...
<@332925665424834560> 
<@186548078453587968> 

While looking around I noticed that the two of you have a pretty spammable core feature that gives the same benefit

Envoy as a base class feature has the ``Get 'em!`` directive granting everyone +1 **status bonus** to attack, and optionally to damage rolls against a certain enemy.

Rhythm subclass for Mystic automatically gives the ``Anthem`` focus spell which gives +1 **status bonus** to attack and damage rolls as well as to save against ``Fascinated`` and ``Confused`` conditions.

Now it is not *necessarily full on bad* but there will be a lot of collisions in very core features of both sides (as the same type of bonuses (both are ``status`` bonuses) don't stack). I don't know if you guys are fine with going with this, or maybe Eszter would like to change her subclass to find something that does not collide like this.
I'm very happy with this token border I made for ur pc
not because omg it's is like super good
but because it is two token borders applied on top
this black one with the lens effect
and this orange crosshair
which by itself did not feel fitting :D
(MY GOD!!!)
(Good morning indeed)
Def feels fitting for a sniper/rifle-wielding character, plus yeah, the crosshair alone looked a bit too vibrant, the black border gives it a more muted visual
[even the bot likes (?) it lol]
(I assume this happens in his dream? :D anyway, if Kuwe'i is able to reply, here it is: )

� I... have figured that much, that the isles need your daughter now more than ever could. I understand the importance of "bringing her to the surface", and I am going to give my best to try to succeed in it.
� However, I am not to make decisions or orders for an ancient, much higher being than I. First you, now I in your name, will try to encourage her into power, yet I am going to respect her choices, as long as they're reasonable.
� This is not me saying I refuse to help. The last thing I want is you to believe I refuse this mission. I am going to put everything I have into to this quest to succeed, as we all need your daughter's help.
� But I ask you; are *you* going to respect your daughter's choices?
� I, uh.... I guess I get it I can't simply just take your legacy or powers in your daughter's place. But I am more willing than ever to help the isles. If not her, I am willing to become as powerful as possible, and become a new protector of the isles.
� If your daughter happens to refuse to take on her duty, will you help me grow more powerful to try and step in her role?
Id ask why were you up so late, but I went to sleep at 6, and woke at 10
So can't judge
As for the buff, since it is a main class feature, I can't really opt out of it :p
(oh yea sry, I should probably not start rp-s at like 2am xddd)
(question is, should I write a reply to the other one too (tbh didn't fully read it yet but it might change based on this)
(It's fineeee xDDD)

<:rugrat:1346476899601481839>

Ahh now i wanna rewatch moana
Doesn't stocky imply short as well? XD
177-180 is everything but short
It gives so much isles vibes
What inspo did you use?
you have to see moana 2 once in hungarian

I didn't use inspo. I woke up, picked up my pencil while still holding my coffee and boom, by the time i woke up, the sketch was done

I haven't seen moana 2 at all... but why, something wrong with the hungarian version?
c:

**No5. The "Battlecry" feat change**
Demoralize action taken through the feat "Battlecry" does not have a range limitation (you still have to perceive the target).
(oh I'm sry I got hit with a "hey btw are you coming to session?" xDDD)
(I see xD)
- I won't respect her choice to live in mental misery and not try to change that. I'd be surprised if she didn't want to help the isles if she believed she could, but wouldn't stand in her way if that is what you ask.
- And I have never stood in your way to greatness and have been urging you to seek what powers you can. If anyone knows how to stop what's happening, it must be Makana, the Watching Woman, she'll give you clear directions if you can get her to trust mortal champions once again.
i wont even say it
you know what to do
I'm not drawing him prego
(yea so I read it, I think nothing additional suddenly happens but you do get an advantage on your next religion check you roll in the campaign just as Papa is quite attuned in his thinking these days)
*Kuwe'i reacts a little weirdly to the phrases said about Quarala, and he'd definitely say a few things, but instead decides not to comment on it anymore. Instead, he mentally sighs before replying to Qing's latter words.*
� Of course it's not that easy to reach her... I am not even surprised.
� Anyway... Is there any information about the Watching Woman worth knowing that you can share? Even little details could help significantly at winning her trust.



(alright)
(my original intention was to SOMEHOW get in "contact" with the Starbreather or just like...pray for a sign or something)
(I don't think Papa ever got any sign or anything like that from the Starbreather, still seems to be the case)
(OH NO WAIT)
(i was gonna say...i wanted him to be able to talk with the spirits more precisely)
(actually wished to ask you for some rp so i can ask some questions of the spirits who aid him)

oh mah

(OH SO PAPA IS A LIGHT CLERI C NOW? XDDD My god I just realized what the voice meant)
(So the Divination is the Keelhaul and Fylkir part?)
(And the voice is just tied with the ritual and his prayers?)
(Like somwhat part of the Divination?)
(the divination itself is that part yes, but the creature you saw was able to use the potential the ritual created to communicate even outside the bounds of the spell)
(also reminder: divination can only be answered by a half-immortal)
(Woah so cool)
(Yeah thought it was someone else)
(So the creature basically told papa that the world will burn and with new potential it shall be recreated?)
(And that its in their hands?)
(TO MAKE A NEW FAITH ANF RELIGION?)
(it was trying to answer Papa's inner struggles, putting his "I'm questioning the loss of my ways" into a more positive light of change he can control, a potential to grow into something new)
(Ah yeah that also makes sense, obviously. Just thought it had a deeper meaning)
(Or like its interconnected with the purpose of the Starbreather)
(You know, like purging everything and have everything remade)
(the Starbreather is quite distant as of yet, he is working slowly, you have a much more pressing matter at hand before that)
(Alright. Have i heard of this fishy half immortal before?)
(The one that just answered me? He seems like a new guy)
(definitely didn't hear about it before the campaign started, since that? Maybe, check your notes/discuss with others to see if something is familiar)
(Yeah thats my second idea xd)
(Okay, well thank you this is very epic)
(I love it)
(Lastly, so would it be possible to talk with the soirits directly? Like actually have a talk with them? As in rping)
(Figured id love to get their intel and opinions, stories and whatnot)
(And generally focusing on maintaining a truly good connection with them, showing that Papa cares for them and that they can come to him for help)

Didn't get any actually
I can't even feel it xD
But I do have to go down to uni later today
What a conversation xD
Ill be there
(i was hoping to speak with someone older and wiser xd)
(idk what other spirits might be in papas amulet)
(so far you mostly focused on spirits of warriors being taken care of by Papa, knowledgable people would be the storytellers of the tribes, or past storytellers, or maybe some sages of the Ikolf from the time of their arrival but most of those (the few that were) would be quite heavily on Skati's side/his servants/etc)
(oh i see)
What is the gameplan, boss?
We gamin I think
I'll be joining as well.

*Speedrunning the backstory*
<:THUMBEATER:874738723823161384>
(actually i have a better idea)
---------------------------------
*Papa a ritu�l�ja ut�n, este fel� megkeresi Ona-on�t.*
*A half-manaki le�ny er�teljes h�rtelen mozdulatokkal l�pked a parton, �rz�sre egy Ikolf t�ncnak t�nik de... a koreogr�fia maga nem valami kiemelked�.*
*Ahogy Papa k�zel�t l�tja, hogy v�r�s k�d kezd el itt-ott manifeszt�l�dni OnaOna k�zel�ben amire a l�ny csak m�rgesen toppant egyet a f�ld�n �s a k�d-kezdem�ny azonnal elt�nik.*

*K�v�ncsian n�zi, hogy mit csin�l a hibrid �s kell� t�vols�gb�l figyeli �t, mostm�r rendes, kih�zott testtart�ssal.* -Oh, kell esetleg seg�ts�g? *K�rdezi az �reg tiefling �rdekl�d�en.* -Eln�z�st, ha megzavarlak, csak szerettem volna sz�t v�ltani veled.
- Csak, hhh, Embl�t�l hallottam egy Ikolf ritu�l�t amivel az �seik kijelentett�k, hogy bossz�t �llnak valakin aki keresztbe tett nekik. Nem tudom, hogy b�rmi haszna lenne-e, m�g Embla se eml�kezett teljesen, hogy hogyan volt de valah�nyszor megpr�b�lkozom vele Skati megpr�b�l bele piszk�tani.
*Vesz egy fesz�lt s�hajt.*
- Csak... ideges�t�...
*M�ly leveg� �s v�gre Papa fel� fordul.*
- Mond mir�l szeretn�l besz�lni? S�t�ljunk picit, valahogy le kell vezetnem magam.
M�k�dhet, szerintem j�
Mikort�l?
*Papa b�lint �s h�tra tett k�zzel v�rja, hogy Ona-ona oda �rjen hozz� �s azt�n egy temp�ban elkezdenek s�t�lni egym�s mellett. P�r csendben elt�lt�tt l�p�s ut�n Papa neh�zkesen megsz�lal.* -El�sz�r is szeretn�m megk�sz�nni, hogy vissza hozt�l az �l�k soraiba. *H�l�san mosolyok a l�ny fel�.* -Nem gondoltam volna, hogy ennyire fura lesz �jra rendesen j�rni... Azt�n nem is hezit�ltam �s elv�geztem egy ritu�l�t, amivel a j�v� bizonytalan foszl�nyait l�ttam.... *Hangja rekedtes �s neh�z, lesulykolt a sok neh�zs�gt�l, ami nemr�g �rte.* -Viszont, ami legink�bb megfogott az a hang �s l�ny, ami seg�tett a var�zslat elv�gz�s�ben... Mond csak, mennyire ismered a f�listeneket?
*Csak mosolyog egyet a k�sz�netre.*
- Egy gy�gy�t�k�nt ez a dolgom, �s most sz�ks�g van r�nk meg ink�bb mint valaha. Biztos vagyok benne, hogy te sem hagyn�l cserben ha valamikor vissza tudn�l hozni, b�r... rem�lem nem lesz r� sz�ks�g.
*Gondolkozik picit.*
- Kettej�kkel tal�lkoztam eddig, Kad�val �s Iolan�val, b�r majd szeretn�m megl�togatni Oldshell-t is valamikor ha lesz r� id�m. Hm, nem ismerted fel, hogy ki seg�tett? Vagy csak elfelejtetted valamelyik�ket tudatosan c�lba venni a ritu�l�val �s nem ismerted fel a hangj�t annak aki v�laszolt? ...nem mintha tudn�m ilyen megt�rt�nhet, s m�g kev�sb� az, hogy velem ez rendszeresen el�fordulna csak tudod... tippelgetek.
*Nevet picit a saj�t szerencs�tlens�g�n.*
(omg she is socially awkward)
(it felt more like she was delibaretly making this joke)
17-18as kezd�s
M�g megl�tjuk hogy k�sz�l�nk el
*Papa b�josnak tal�lja, hogy Ona-ona ennyit magyar�z �s t�relmesen v�gig hallgatja, amit mond miel�tt v�laszol neki.* -Nos, legink�bb mag�hoz a Starbreatherhez sz�ltam, de aki v�laszolt az egy...�ltal�m �gy hiszem nem ismert f�listen volt. *Papa felpillant az �gre, am�g azon van, hogy pontosan visszaeml�kezzen arra ami keveset l�tott a l�nyb�l.* -Egy hatalmas tengeri l�ny volt, hegyes orral �s nagy, hossz� h�n�rok l�gtak r�la, pikkelyei pedig �ramvonallal ellent�tben n�ttek a test�n... *A l�nyra n�z kicsit zavart �s k�v�ncsi szemekkel v�rva, hogy mit reag�l erre az inform�ci�ra.*
18 probably jobb
At least for me xd
( <@886672003396927530> )
- Oh... ya � m�r nincs itt a vil�gban, vagy ha igen akkor nem hajland� v�laszolni senkihez; hmm... tengeri l�ny. H�t n�zz�k kik vannak, Kada a dr�ma, Iolana a kreativit�s, Oldshell az id�, Quing a rothad�s, Watching Woman a sors, s van egy hatodik meg hetedik is akik a potenci�l �s a t�vols�g f�listenei. Sz�val gondolom valamelyik�k ezekb�l?
-Hm... *Papa igaz�n meglep�dik ezen �s m�gink�bb gondolataiba ragad.* -Mi l�ttunk egy madarat, aki f�listen volt...
-De akkor �...hogy-hogy, m�rmint..Hogy �rted, hogy nincs itt?
*OnaOna megr�zza a fej�t*
- A t�vols�g f�listen�r�l voltak eml�t�sek, hogy az archipelago fel� lehet, de a potenci�lr�l senki nem tud semmit. M�g annyira se szokta megmutatni mag�t mint amit te eml�tett�l, b�r meglep�en az�rt akt�vabb tud lenni mint p�ld�ul a Watching Woman... nem mondom, hogy sokkal, de van r� p�lda legal�bb.
-Hm...Ez igaz�n �rdekes �s elgondolkodtat�. Mi lehet az oka annak ha egy f�listen nem �ppen a legakt�vabb? Mi befoly�solja legjobban a behat�s�t a vil�gra?
- Mi az oka annak, hogy te nem volt�l ezel�tt a legakt�vabb? Mi befoly�solja legjobban a te behat�sodat a vil�gra? Ne feledd, f�l isten az azt jelenti f�l haland�. �k is ugyan�gy tudnak hib�zni, megvannak a saj�t bels� indokaik, minden mint nek�nk is.
-Igazad van. Valami t�nyleg sokat v�ltozik...Ha �gy vessz�k �n is 30+ �vig aludtam...Lehet a Potenci�l is most t�r csak mag�hoz annak rem�ny�ben, hogy v�ltozik a vil�g �s az emberek... *N�mi aggodalommal arc�n a horizont fel� n�z.* -Viszont ez azt is jelentheti, hogy m�s f�listenek netal�n elhalulnak vagy kisebb szerep�k lesz? *Ekkor bel� has�t a felismer�s �s hangja fennakad.* -Ak�r �j f�listenek is �letre kelhetnek?
https://youtu.be/CLzMPM1anl4?si=fgCNm1-mDg5dg5HO

- Ki tudja? B�r nem l�tom, hogy hogyan tudna megsz�nni egy f�listen, max nyugt�ra t�r egy id�re, mint amikor megsz�nik a haland� alakjuk... Igazat megvalva, biztos �rdekes lenne err�l t�bb legend�t hallani de nincs igaz�n id�m ilyesmikre mostan�ban, egyre csak vesz�lyesebb a vil�g �s lassan tanulnak az �jonc gy�gy�t�k...
*S�hajt kicsit, majd hozz� teszi*
- De ha megtudsz valamit err�l a potenci�lr�l mes�lj majd mindenk�pp! Az embereknek tudniuk kell min�l t�bbet a k�r�l�tt�nk l�v� vil�gr�l
-Mindenk�ppen. Szeretn�k minn�l jobban szolg�lat�ra lenni a szigeteknek. Neked is sz�vesen seg�tek a riut�l�dban. �n is ismerek p�r t�ncot. Ha mes�lsz r�la t�bbet biztos vagyok benne, hogy ki tudunk tal�lni valamit, hogy m�k�dj�n.


- Ha t�nyleg komolyabban neki pr�b�lkozunk lehet jobb ha t�bbiek is itt lesznek. Nem tudom Skati mi�rt akarja ennyire, hogy ne vigyem v�gbe de min�l ink�bb el akarja ker�lni ann�l ink�bb �gy �rzem, hogy valami nagyon hasznos lehet...
*Papa halkan kuncog �s sohajt egyet.* -El�ny�nkre v�lna, ha h�tr�nyba helyezn�nk �t �s Keelhault. T�nyleg, a l�tom�ssal kapcsolatban... *Papa elmes�li amit a ritu�l�ja k�zben l�tott �s tapasztalt.*
-Szerinted? Mit gondolsz mit terveznek? Volt valami h�r fel�l�k mostans�g?

This is draft I have for the backstory for now

Looks good to me :D
nice o7

Question, which ship would Nurthaqil want the kids on?
Worldship Arcadia (the one you are on as well) to make quite sure you don't get separated
or
The flagship Aurora, which is definitely the safest option but if there is any issue with the experimental drift travel and the worldships somehow get separated from the Aurora then the kids will be far away too


I was feeling my pillows, sensually, steamily
Me way too many times: https://youtu.be/Q5AQbJNs4h0?si=NCxYb5DEsykrrXwK
- H�t, eln�z�sre Keelhaul vissza akarja szerezni a haj�j�t, de odalent a v�z alatt nem fogja tudni megszerelni sz�val hamarosan erre fog tartani. Egy j� id�pont lenne arra, hogy elkapj�tok, �n is seg�tek majd amiben tudok, van egy Sunburst amit sz�vesen az arc�ba dobn�k az�rt amit nagypap�val tett...
- Skati... nemtudom, mire j�tszik, de egy�rtelm�en nem tart minket el�g vesz�lyesnek ahhoz, hogy r�nk �sz�tsa a sereg�t... vagy �lve kellenek neki az emberek valami�rt. Egyik �tlet sem tetszik igaz�n...
*Papa meg�ll a l�pteiben �s v�llait megeresztve n�z Ona-on�ra.* -Ha tehetn�m m�r most megk�zden�k vele �s akkor tal�n v�gre minden �jra a hely�n lenne... *B�natosan megr�zza a fej�t �s �ssze szor�tja ajkait.* -B�r sajnos, att�l f�lek, �gy is egy �j korszak hajnal�n vagyunk...Kada elmond�sa szerinte a Starbreather �jra akarja festeni fest�v�sznak, amire minket festett...Legal�bb is azokat, akiket erre a vil�gra sz�nt.. *Egy neh�z s�hajjal a partot sim�t� tengert n�zi.*
.
(csak eml�tem, hogy nekem ugyanaz a jelz�s j�n ha egy sima �zenet �rkezik vagy ha pingelsz xD)
(oh, sorry xd)
(csak rossz megszok�s. mostan�ban �gy reag�lok rpkre, hogy v�laszolok r�juk)
(nem felt�tlen rossz, csak jeleztem hogy n�lam nincs semmi extra haszna XDD)
(ah okay)
- Am�g nem vagyunk biztosak abban, hogy el tudunk b�nni vele addig ne ugr�ljunk harcokba, nem tudlak �r�kk� visszahozni, �s ha valahogy elveszik valaki teste... csak egy es�ly�nk lesz, nem hiszem, hogy m�gegy ennyire tiszta gy�ngy lenne a szigeten...
*Emeli meg a nyakl�nc�t amiben m�r hi�nyzik egy kissebb gy�ngy �gy csak egy kis �s egy kifejezetten gy�ny�r� nagyobb gy�ngy f�nylik.*
- Sz�val csak... �vatosan, nem hiszem, hogy a szigeten b�rki m�s k�pes lenne Fylkirt vissza tenni a s�rba.

*OnaOna gondolkodik kicsit.*
- Nemtudom Kad�t�l mit hiszek vagy mit nem, ha j�l vettem ki az eg�sz ott indult, hogy elsz�rt valami ritu�l�t Kadaur tetej�n, nem? Nem mondom, hogy nincs igaza csak... nemtudom, t�bbet kellene tudnom miel�tt b�rmi d�nt�sre jutn�k itt
(AYO)
*Papa szem�ld�k�t r�ncolva gondondolkodik.* -Te vagy az, aki gyakrabban felj�r oda a szent�lyhez...Tudod mi van Kadaur tetej�n, igaz?
*There is a bit of silence, feeling of someone intensely trying to remember details from ages past.*
- She is... reclusive, ever since Kumuhea's fall, before that I have talked with her a few times, she is the daughter of the Starbreather, and she enjoys watching the world go by as a play, bringing her something truly unique and one of a kind can surely help you get on her good side. She has told me to gather my strength even before the eruption happened. Yet what her plan is she refused to say...
- Igen, egy templom, a t�k�rk�pe annak ami a Black Atoll felett lebeg.
*Papa �rtetlen�l f�lre d�nti a fej�t.* -M�g nem j�rtunk a Black Atolln�l...El�gg� balj�s dolgokat mondanak r�la, az egyik bar�tunk is ott vesztette el az erej�t, Kamalani a ki'ai. M�gis mi az a hely? Furcsa l�nyek j�nnek fel onnan...
- Ha a legend�k igazak a Starbreather ott �rintette le el�sz�r Marrowt a vil�g v�szn�n, s �gy a saj�t v�re, az ichor amib�l minden ami �l s minden ami nem, oda t�r vissza, hogy �jra a teremt�s r�sze lehessen.
- Az Ecliptic... nem tudom mit gondoljak r�la, vannak eml�t�sek, hogy r�gen is l�teztek, de... sosem voltak ilyen agressz�vek, vagy ennyire sokan. Soha senki nem j�tt r�, hogy mi�rt vannak itt, vagy mit akarnak.
-Hm, megint csak Kad�t tudom id�zni ezzel kapcsolatban. Az a feladatuk, hogy megtiszt�ts�k a szigeteket, hogy �jra indulhasson az �let �s megszabaduljanak a m�regt�l, ami megrontotta a term�szetet... *Vissza pillant Keyport fel�.* -�gy l�tom a lelkek �s a Starbreather t�nyleg el�g szigor� kik�t�sek alapj�n csin�lta meg az itteni t�rv�nyeket. Hm, de akkor mi a helyzet azokkal az elz�rt l�nyekkel a Mirescale-ek alatt?
*Kuwe'i also remains silent for many seconds, stashing away each little piece of information away into his mind.*
� "Something truly unique and one of a kind", you say...
� **I am** truly unique and one of a kind, that is for sure. Especially now, that my blessed form had been... "tainted". But I am guessing that is not going to be enough for her.
� However, some plays require the audience as well to make a story full. And sure as the darkest deeps we actors will ask for the audience's intervention for such an interactive story.
� Thank you for these informations. The rest... I believe we will have to see what the near future holds for us.
- S akkor mi lesz, csak �jra kezdi az eg�szet? Egy m�v�sz t�nyleg csak �gy elpuszt�tan� az �lete m�v�t? Hogy lehet egy ennyire grand l�lek mint a Starbreather ennyire... sz�vtelen?
- Nem tal�ltam semmit r�luk, nem tudom mit gondoljak arr�l, hogy van egy m�sik vil�g elz�rva alattunk... s f�leg arr�l, hogy nem t�ntek a leg bar�ts�gosnak...
(AAAAAGH THIS IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION)
(xD)
(so many things to solve)
- Thus, you will see. Now rest champion, gather your strength, tomorrow already smells of the mix of ichor and blood...
(my last reply literally didn't even have new info lol)
(XD)
(no i mean like so many info that needs to be dealt with)

*Papa egyet�rt�en p�lint.* -Meg tudom �rteni, hogy mi alapj�n d�nt �gy, sokunknak nem k�ne itt lenni. Mi bor�tottuk fel az egyens�lyt azzal, hogy ide j�tt�nk �s kapzsi m�d kifosztottuk a szigeteket...Viszont azt �n sem igaz�n �rtem, hogy mi alapj�n alakulnak ki ezek a szigor� szab�lyok, mint, hogy nem lehet olvasni vagy �rni, mintha a fejl�d�s ellen menne...
(XDDD)
-Egyet �rtek sok dologgal, amit a lelkek tan�tanak, hisz nekik k�sz�nhetem az �letem �s az er�imet, amivel most sz�mtalan embernek seg�tek, de...mivel nem vagyok ide val�si, m�g �gy is vannak kit�ltetlen lyukak..B�r..Lehet ez a l�nyeg...A bizalom abban, hogy �, a lelkek �s a f�listenek mindent k�zben tartanak.
- A term�szet legt�bb t�rv�nye arra hajt, hogy ne legyen v�ltoz�s, az emberek boldogok az �let�k egyszer�s�g�ben, az �llatok �lnek vad�sznak �s vad�szottak, n�v�nyek n�nek �s elhallnak... De az Ikolf nem tud ezzel �lni, �k k�b�l �p�tenek, m�gi�kkal uralj�k a vil�got maguk k�r�l... nemtudom, hogy valaha b�k�re tud-e tal�lni ez a kett�.

- S mivan ha abban a vil�gban amit �k terveznek nincs sz�modra hely? Vagy a szeretteidnek? Lehet, hogy egyet �rtesz vel�k de meddig, s vajon �k is �rzik-e ezt a bizonytalans�got? Ha igen mi�rt nem nyugtatnak meg arr�l, hogy ez nem �gy lesz?
(god damn, yeah, this is though)
(I'm literally reading these while listening to Unsolicited Advice XDDD)
-Nem is tudom...Egyr�szt azt �rzem, hogy m�r elavult vagyok �s �reg, a lelkek �s a szigeteknek szenteltem az id�m �s azt, hogy k�pes vagyok seg�teni m�soknak...A s�t�t m�ltam �s a jelenlegi... legal�bb is m�ltb�li, rokkant �llapotom t�k�letes arra, hogy a lelkej vessleje legyek, valaki, aki �gy tesz, ahogy �k k�v�n�k, az�rt, hogy fenntartsam azt az egyens�lyt, amibe belerond�tottam.
(the thing is that papa is in a very hard spot rn because to him, this place was salvation, redemption and a final resting place...now everything is turning upside down and he is like...ah fuck what whould I do? Who shall I be?)

Please make sure you know your own abilities, it's okay if you don't know all the rules and whatnot, but remember what thing you can specifically do due to your ancestry/class and the direct points connected to that
so if your ability says "and you can then make a Recall Knowledge check on a creature you target"
know what recall knowledge is
know what things you are generally allowed to target
etc. etc.

simply so things flow smoothly

tbh part of me is afraid to listen to those, in fear that it turns out to be some AI slop
Not mentioned that it's AI, and it doesn't sound that janky either
I'm pretty sure Kuroi's songs are not ai

3D nyomtatott gerinccsigoly�kkal sikeresen visszaford�tottak teljes �s permanens paral�zist patk�nyokban. A siker ar�ny 60% f�l�tt van az els� akt�v kis�rleti f�zisban. This is some seriously amazing news for science.
�gy a gerincvel�vel meg az idegekkel egy�tt?
Basically they reversed cells into stem cells (the ones that let you grow and regenerate) and molded them into microscopic scaffolding inside the vertebra.
Ezek p�r h�t alatt elkezdtek kiny�lni a csigoly�b�l �s a s�r�lt idegeket sikeresen �sszen�vesztett�k.
A patk�nyok nem futk�roztak ut�na egy�rtelm�en, de egy j� p�r h�t alatt elkezdett �jra j�rni t�bben.

*When Samantha realizes she can't catch up to you she manages to get you to rush between two houses that* ***should*** *be safe. But suddenly she appears sliding in UNDER one of the houses cutting of a big corner and barely poking you on the knee. Kuwe'i is fairly certain that tunnel/underway did not exist when he was a kid.*


\- Did you guys carve that out?!
*Kuwe'i turns around just in time so he won't get caught, surprised and in disbelief.*

<@&1209957580164702270>
The session start times might need to be pushed like 15 mins back due to my internship, I'm yet to see exact times

I know and that was late for me too xd

If anything Fridays are still open, no?
The only issue with fridays are that if we have irl gettogethers they are either on fridays or saturdays.

Okay this is such a 10/10 news, I absolutely love it, full support

Nepal had it's recent rebellion mostly lead by genZ
successfully overthrew their corrupt goverment and they decided to hold the emergency elections by voting ON **DISCORD**
The military accepted the voting results and the new prime minister is being introduced to their post right now
Heeeell yeaaaa xD
the welcoming speech from the minister was also through discord
(and ofc other channels too)

everyone available for monday??
probably yeah
Seems like yes
Have arrived hom
Tho there were two drunk, filthy 20something year olds who... were almost got kicked off from the bus
They definitely angered the bus driver
Aaaaand of course they were traveling to the same stop as me
They were quite questionable, but luckily they went in a different direction
My legendary +3 black hoodie with bonus to stealth and intimidation cloaked me enough for the folks to avoid me xD
That's gud to hear xdd

Youtube has changed what a "view" is
"views" on videos are not much more about "*engaged views*"
it is not fully known how this is, but if you something like:
- actively click on a video instead of autoplaying it
- like / subscribe / comment on / share the video
- open the video description
you will ***maybe*** count as an engaged view, giving the video 1 view
if you don't or the system doesn't feel like it, you don't count as a full view
this resulted in a 15% income drop towards most youtubers, as well as a funny (although rare) phenomena where a video can have more likes than views perfectly legally

Youtube also changed how they recommend videos
they push smaller creators more (which is nice)
however as they approach the monetization treshold they get cut off from this "boost" to make it hard to actually get monetized on your channel
which is very scummy...

Youtube also seemingly changed one of it's old systems called "Restricted Mode", this mode exists since 2010, and youtube says they didn't touch it, however in the past 30 days it has become way more agressive. This mode was before now constantly off and you could manually turn it on, which helped hide videos not meant for school or work settings, this was a perfectly fair manual opt-in feature.
Now, seemingly some kind of algorithm, very possibly an AI, has gotten control of it, and if it ***thinks*** you may be under 18, or at work or in school it turns Restricted Mode on silently.
Restricted Mode hides videos it feels inproper completely, not just from autoplay or your base feed, but while it is on, you cannot get notifications of restricted videos coming out, *cannot see hidden videos on searches*, and ***cannot see hidden videos if you browse a channel's videos section***. Please do check if this was turned on for you or not.

To check on pc click on your profile top right and see if this is on or not (you want it ``off``)
the small channel part is sad, gah damn XD


(context for latter)

I should be too
Nepal's elite forces are called the Gurkha, they have fought the brittish empire and got a draw (as a much, much smaller force), they fought the mongol empire and got a them to retreat, they fought China and got the to retreat, they are insanely respected in Nepal and very disciplined etc
And one of their mottos/quotes is just seriously badass, the rough translation is "if someone says they are not afraid of death, they are either lying or a Gurkha"
After a rebellion usually it's the military that swoops in and takes control, filling the power vacuum by force

This is now what happened here. The military swooped in, calmed down the protesters to make sure no more damage is done, and asked the protesting group who their representative is and had a proper smooth re-establishment of power by getting who the people want up into position
Update, their elected new minister is the former chief of justice, a politician with no party and a long history of somewhat successful anti-corruption campaigns
She is possibly the best choice that could've been made,
Also first female prime minister of Nepal,
This is a temporary position for about 6 months until proper elections can be made
She said that she's honored and will carry out her duties and will uphold the values genZ placed in her
Cool, but did you send this to shit-posting on purpose?

Those are for another setting
That doesn't mean it ain't cool
Oh yea true
(plus we are already mashing settings. Changelings, shifters and kalashtars never touched land in toril)
Idk how to feel about the Sorcerer-king patron subclass being a psionic subclass
Idk it kinda feels forced to me
Bucco could't give powers to psions?
No as in it makes you a psiom
Basically it just allowes you to use your pact spells without V and S
That is not psionics
That is nonverbal casting
Exactly but it calls it psionic ToT
Ah
Okay
I guess flavour xan be handwaved

Ofc but like...this is not psionics
Imo it has to be 100% part of the characters identity
So you use their force of will... Huh that is interesting.
You bend the mind of your subjects, that can be psionics. Not the biggest fan but I guess it works kind of?
I think the gladiator is just fucking everything they thought of xd
What does that do?
Its another dommy mommy/daddy class
Read it xd. Bust basically uses mastery properties on top of mastery properties while dealing bonus dmg
Pretty much a battle master but charisma basex
Ah. Mastery property stacking. A battlemaster with limited options
Funnily enough I think one could put this subclass together with a BM. Like... Almost one to one replica.
Okay maimed is really strong xD
But the save DC will be abismal on it okay.
Yeah i think the bustedness of the subclass makes up for the fact that a fighter usually doesnt have a high cha
Nah it's not busted. It's a bit stronger than a basic BM chasi but it will have less amount of uses of their abilities. Bm will spam it 4 times per short rest in the beginning going up to 6 (7 with a feat) uses. Gladiator has good abilities but it will have a lower save DC on them and at the very most 4 uses per rest. Probs more like 3 in most cases
It runs into the same issues as every second fighter does. BM is so good it wants to replacate it. BM should have been base class so subclasses can be addons
But I guess wotc is allergic to good game design xD
Imma drop this in here too
It's To Be Hero X spoilers, but honestly, out of context, it's really not saying a lot xddd
Is he sudoku?
Brother
And is he a hero yet?
Is is he still a to be hero
He is a hero xD not X, but he is a hero nonetheless
Ah
Ok
He's Nice
I mean yeah
He is a hero

I was doing some drawing and I was pretty happy with it, even got around to shading, lighting and coloring it, and then I woke up, so my drawing just got deleted by my brain forever XD

It is
He is no hero no more
But a hero no hero
The dream itself was a mish-mash of a lot of different scenes: One was about us shopping in some alt equivalent of Stop Shop. There was a shop with strange, crocheted suits, the other had some D&D/fantasy figurines, plushies, basically an epic toy shop. I also got a dragon figurine from here, so that's also gone now. Then there was a part where we got on a literal magic bus, which varied between a regular Veszpr�m purple bus and a classroom, and what makes it funnier is that Baba Yaga was there and teaching us magic or arts and stuff like that. I remember her talking about people who take her up on her magic teaching being gone for about a 1000 years, but I was just drawing and listening/witnessing another scene about some kids murdering and burying their younger brother in some shallow grave in the middle of some grassy place
He is back that's for sure xD
When I started out drawing, I drew with pencil, then somehow filled the colors in like it was digital

Also there was one of my phone decorations, which I never ever used for fear of losing/damaging it, just hanging from (I think my first ever) phone that was in my right pocket
XD
Man, this isn't even the 100th dream I got robbed by

I sometimes (a lot of times nowadays) dream about people who I am either no longer in contact with or are dead
The best worst game ever
Oh wow
I do think of them while I'm awake and probably that's why
Not just out of the blue
Although every now and then I do dream of stuff I do not think about actively and then the dream just makes me live it for better or worse
I am pretty sure in this dream I had tonight, Baba Yaga and the alternating magic bus was there because we talked about the Magic School Bus a couple days ago XD
So Baba Yaga was the equivalent to Ms. Mitzy
Music is banger too
Or Ms. Frizzle if you're *american*
crazy ahh

So, since we won't have a "prep for the fight" session before the irl one (unless you guys work some magic and it's suddenly possible on one of the days)
How do we want to go about this?
- Try to rush prep and then go for the fight on the irl session hoping we can do it all in the like 5 hrs we'll have?
- Just use the irl session to prep for the fight/rp, maybe start it and find second one shot time sometime next week or smth to finish it (online)
- Smth else I didn't think of?
We probably won't finish it in 5 hours, especially if it's irl
Yea... >.<
I like option 2
I see that the most reasonable too
*Something else I didn't think of: Rewind time to back when **everyone** was in Hungary and had free days*
Ah yes, duh
Could you please prep that ritual for us when we get there?

okay guys, rp heavy session

in this 5 hours everyone gets to talk about 10 minutes
(yea I counter it, 13 peeps, if gm also describes stuff comes out to about 10 minutes per person in 5 hours xD)
They are pretty quick in combat. They don't have waiting time at all as their sessions happen on air and taking up too much time decreases viewer count
okay that is fair
But yes that is a big issue xD.
This is their biggest playercount yet right?
idk man xD
court cases about arrested protesters are getting jury nullification left and right in Washington xD

jury nullification means they ask the jury "can you treat this case without getting your personal opinion or feelings involved?"
and they can't find a jury where enough people goes "yea I can"
xD
(there is about 1k arrested people, but nobody can be prosecuted XDD)
yes
Also i dont think everyone will be available all times
Nobody's gonna get spotlight if they play as one party xD
there is a guy who threw a sandwich at a soldier/police officer (it is the same thing under Trump's rule) and then said on record "yes it was me, I threw the sandwich", and he can't get anything without getting prosecuted
xD
They have 3 guest spots as well but those are not confirmed yet on who and what PCs
(these are "grand jury" issues, where before trial it is decided if there is even a chance that a crime has happened or not)

Plant Growth
> This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below. Overgrowth. Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected. Enrichment. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one Plant Growth per year.

Finnish imperfect past tense... hhhhhhh this ain't getting easier does it?

if the word ends in an ``u`` or ``o``
you just add an ``i`` at the end, great
if it ends in ``a``, ``�``, ``e``, or ``i`` you remove that letter and add an ``i`` in it's place
HOWEVER
if it's first syllable AND it's last syllable are both with ``a`` then you change the ending ``a`` into ``oi`` ;-;
xD

(the -n at the end is that **I** am doing that
*Ajaa*
it means to drive

JUGGLEPOSTING
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL
(sec)
so here is this application, called jugglinglab
made to nicely animate juggling patterns
for teaching purposes
however
tumblr found out it exists
and immediatelly started making up revolutionary juggling techniques

very easy and normal tech


oups someone accidentally made actual juggling

this guy is just rude
so... they learned how to put custom images in

and... whatever this is





the juggling factory going on full speed

as some1 that knows how to juggle, I approve
this is where I just cracked and started cry laughing
xD
oh my goad they made a game you can play on a board (called boardgame) out of our tabletop roleplaying game!
you no longer need a table just a board!
what an improvement!

I was thinking about giving Papa more tattoos as well in time
His needs to be INKED XD
Nothing's stopping you :D he could've went to get more tattooes too when Kuwe'i got his new glowy one
Honestly. Tattoos on the horns?
Yooo
Im just waiting for the right time
That's like tattooing bones O.O i have no clue how you do that, but sounds epic
The right time is the time you can get them
(that's what we call carving)
It has to have meaning
Yess
Honestly idk its like a goat's horn so it shouldnt hurt
Or is it more like a bovine?
The meaning is that it looks epic, so it makes us epic, and that's meaning enough for us to feel epic <a:hellmage_emilyyeh:833496986657357824>
Carved and painted

Bought them one by one over the years
I once had the full thing pirated, but it was on an old laptop
Then later, i started playing on then-our pc, on which Daniel didn't want piracy to happen, so i had no choice but to buy the expansions one by one
Now i have enough that i don't want/need to pirate
�s azok honnan voltak lekal�zkodva? XD

Yes cuz there was some movement against pirated stuff where they lock your steam or epic accounts if it detects a pirated game on your device. Otherwise I'm fine with it.

dont want to be rude but that sounded just like my old man, who figured out what L + ratio means after its long since not use bye the youth
You know, for the uncultured individuals, definitely not me of course, but what does L+ratio mean?
XD
XD
Some of my friends still use it but it is true that I barely know anyone from the "youth"
In online slang, "L ratio" or "L+ratio" is an insult meaning someone's post or comment is a loss (L) and has received a ratio, which is a high number of negative replies or comments compared to likes, indicating widespread disapproval or mockery. It signifies that an online post was so poorly received that people are engaging with it primarily to criticize it.

Never have i ever experienced joy before upon receiving an excel table
Never have I not experienced joy upon receiving an excel table
(I was tasked to make one excel table out 16 or so other, while putting its contents into order. Today i received The One, original excel i was supposed to recreate, tho i'll still have to work on it, but at least i won't have to have 16 or so separate tables open)
Whatever xD
The One Excel
A lifesaver
Life and sanity saver
-# What work does to you i guess
I see xD

Enigmatic gentleman who's courtly is his description
So
Like the other 3 dudes that act the same way. He at least look cool af
Edgy too xD
My favourite part is when he invited the traveller to visit him whenever he's free. Something like "May you come and visit my grave... I mean, the grave I usually guard"
XDDD
Oh and he's a fae
But he's the sweetest, most gentlemaning dude ever
He's just a tiny bit edgy :3
you drunk again dicegod, go to sleep

I can be evil but that kind of suffering I cannot bestow on others, only take
Now ***this*** is something I'd join if the group picks it up
<:VeryHmm:963844125155811378>
Haha I honestly thought of you first thing, when I saw it :d
I'd be down to get it, looks promising
I would say wait a *bit* on more reviews as in a few days you can't get a good picture
especially on a game that is admitted to not be finished by the devs
Oh obviously. I have no money currently anyways :p

https://youtu.be/YpMl1OT_qGc
if I ever get the money to make major political lobbying, I will solely push trains and public transport
Saw these on a post about the drama
Does seem sussy ngl
"while writing the script there was a major derailment on a hungarian line, luckily no dead but two seriously injured; the rescue train sent to take over the passangers has also deraild on the way to the destionation"
Hungarian goverment reaction: "don't worry, we'll make sure to permanently close down these old lines"
-.-"
if someone even mentions doing something on crypto, I do not care what who or why, they are a scammer, disengage immediatelly
You just wait till they engineer the disengagement rugpull <:Unhingedcatoo:1154687007356899388>

Im so ready for Planescape
Mit futtatn�l?
Planescapet
Im motivated to run some one-shots and adventures
Its such a vast setting
Igen, de milyen oneshot-ot, adventure-t?
well then set one up and then put out a call (in that order)
Att�l f�gg mit szeretn�tek.
Lehettek t�rist�k vagy multiuniverz�lis kaladorok
Vannak hozz� backgroundok meg featek
Or you can be faction members
Idk, ANYTHING
Anything is possible
set something up, have a concrete idea worked out so you can recruit people behind it
I was hoping to hold occasional irl one-shots
When time allows it for people but ofc it can work on dc as well
I just wanna boast about it so much
https://youtu.be/GBpHkpKL_Z0?si=iQs42PwHBYtNG251
I feel like its finally something new that we might need for peopele to enjoy playing dnd
Again
yeah, let's go, make an idea
I think its a really undiscovered area
For many of us
yea, I'm also running scifi
it's a blast :D
Endre peer-pressuring me into being the new forever-dm
Anna would be part of the Athar xdd or the Mercykillers ToT
Probs
*wdym forever?!*
I'm peer pressuring you to run smth xd
I know im just scared
Bc if not going smooth im dead
It won't go smooth, and people will love it
I hope. I just dont want my players undermining the story experience.
So... don't take the ones you fear might do that
Its sad that i only have negative experiences with gming
But i wanna be care-free about it
Anyways
Im gonna finish the last book and think of something
I was thinking about having a Planescape channel for that setting specifically.
Not just for me but for others so those interested (who have the role) can learn about the setting and the Outlands and the Outer Planes
Discovering more lore, forgotten deities, planes, realms etc.
